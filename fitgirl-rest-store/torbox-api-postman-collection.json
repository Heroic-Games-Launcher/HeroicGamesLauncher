		"description": "### Full documentation for TorBox\n\nCurrent API Base: `https://api.torbox.app`\n\nCurrent API Version: `v1`\n\nYou can find more API docs here: [http://api.torbox.app/docs](http://api.torbox.app/docs) (they aren't as great as these, but is in a format most people would be familiar to).\n\n### General Information\n\n- You can rely on both `success` booleans or status codes to determine if a call was a success. Status code `200` always means a success. `403` means authentication error. `500` means something went wrong on TorBox's end. `400` means the user did something wrong, or an input wasn't correct, or expected.\n    \n- There will always be a user-friendly message in `detail` for a reason why a call was a failure, or a success message. You may forward these directly to users.\n    \n- The `/usenet` and the `/webdl` API endpoints are nearly the same as the `/torrents` API endpoints apart from some different named inputs and outputs.\n    \n- All outputs are JSON unless otherwise specified. Check out the examples to be sure.\n    \n\n### Rate Limits\n\n- Unless stated below, all endpoints are rate limited to **5/sec** per IP, no edge rate limiting.\n    \n- `POST` /torrents/createtorrent is rate limited to **60/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.\n    \n- `POST` /usenet/createusenetdownload is rate limited to **60/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.\n    \n- `POST` /webdl/createwebdownload is rate limited to **60/hour** per IP and **10/min** at edge.\n    \n- If you have a specific application, please contact us with your IP and reason to get unlimited requests.\n    \n\n### Standard Response\n\nBelow is the standard JSON response that most requests will return. In short, always use the \"success\" key to determine if a request was successful or not, \"error\" to determine the exact error reason, \"detail\" as a user-friendly message whether success or error, and data contains the response information you are looking for.\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"success\": boolean, // whether a response is successful or not\n    \"error\": string, // an error code if there was an error, or null if success\n    \"detail\": string, // a user-friendly message\n    \"data\": any // usually an object/dict, but can be anything, check the examples\n}\n\n ```\n\n### Errors Table\n\nErrors codes are part of the standard response type. If the code ends in \"ERROR\", the error is the server's fault else that error is something that the client caused.\n\n| **Error Code** | Error Meaning |\n| --- | --- |\n| DATABASE_ERROR | Could not access internal database/memory store information. |\n| UNKNOWN_ERROR | The reason for the error is unknown. Usually there will be error data attached in the \"data\" key. In these cases please report the request to [contact@torbox.app](https://mailto:contact@torbox.app). |\n| NO_AUTH | There are no provided credentials. |\n| BAD_TOKEN | The provided token is invalid. |\n| AUTH_ERROR | There was an error verifying the given authentication. |\n| INVALID_OPTION | The provided option is invalid. |\n| REDIRECT_ERROR | The server tried redirecting, but it faulted. |\n| OAUTH_VERIFICATION_ERROR | The server tried verifying your OAuth token, but it was not accepted by the provider. |\n| ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND | If you have hit an endpoint that doesn't exist. |\n| ITEM_NOT_FOUND | The item you queried cannot be found. |\n| PLAN_RESTRICTED_FEATURE | This feature is restricted to users of higher plans. The user is recommended to upgrade their plan to use this endpoint. |\n| DUPLICATE_ITEM | This item already exists. |\n| BOZO_RSS_FEED | This RSS feed is invalid or not a well-formed XML. |\n| TOO_MUCH_DATA | Client sent too much data to the API. Please keep requests under 100MB in size. |\n| DOWNLOAD_TOO_LARGE | This download is oversized for the user's plan. The user is recommended to upgrade their plan to download this file.  <br>  <br>Free Plan Limit: **10737418240** bytes  <br>Essential Plan Limit: **214748364800** bytes  <br>Standard Plan Limit: **214748364800** bytes  <br>Pro Plan Limit: **536870912000** bytes |\n| MISSING_REQUIRED_OPTION | The API is missing required information to process the request. |\n| TOO_MANY_OPTIONS | Client sent too many options. Usually this has to do with the API requiring only 1 option but the client sent more than the required. |\n| BOZO_TORRENT | The torrent sent is not a valid torrent. |\n| NO_SERVERS_AVAILABLE_ERROR | There are no download servers available to handle this request. This should never happen. If you receieve this error, please contact us at [contact@torbox.app](https://mailto:contact@torbox.app). |\n| MONTHLY_LIMIT | User has hit the maximum monthly limit. It is recommended user upgrade their account to be able to download more. |\n| COOLDOWN_LIMIT | User is on download cooldown. It is recommended user upgrade their account to be able to bypass this restriction. |\n| ACTIVE_LIMIT | User has hit their max active download limit. It is recommended user upgrade their account or purchase addons to bypass this restriction. |\n| DOWNLOAD_SERVER_ERROR | There was an error interacting with the download on the download server. It is recommdned to simply wait some time before trying again. |\n| BOZO_NZB | The NZB sent is not a valid NZB file. |\n| SEARCH_ERROR | There was an error searching using the TorBox Search API. |\n| INVALID_DEVICE | The client is sending requests from the incorrect device. |\n| DIFF_ISSUE | The request parameters sent does not allow for this request to complete. |\n| LINK_OFFLINE | The link given is inaccessible or has no online files. |\n| VENDOR_DISABLED | This vendor account has been disabled. Please contact support. |\n| BOZO_REGEX | The regex you entered is bad. |\n| BAD_CONFIRMATION | The confirmation code you have given is invalid. |\n| CONFIRMATION_EXPIRED | The confirmation code you have given is expired. Request a new code. |\n| BOZO_FILE | This file doesn't match the required mimetype. Please use a different file. |\n\n### Translation to Real-Debrid API\n\nUseful for if you want to add TorBox to an app where Real-Debrid is already existing. These are the API routes that are nearly the same with Real-Debrid API routes. You will have to change things such as parameters and check outputs as they both are not the same. You can find docs to Real-Debrid's API [here](https://api.real-debrid.com/).\n\n| Real-Debrid API Routes | TorBox API Routes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `GET` /torrents | `GET` /torrents/mylist |\n| `GET` /torrents/info/{id} | `GET` /torrents/mylist?id={id} |\n| `GET` /torrents/instantAvailability/{hash} | `GET` /torrents/checkcached |\n| `PUT` /torrents/addTorrent | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent |\n| `POST` /torrents/addMagnet | `POST` /torrents/createtorrent |\n| `POST` /torrents/selectFiles/{id} | **None**, _not needed. Torrents will download all files. This will not be changed._ |\n| `DELETE` /torrents/delete/{id} | `POST` /torrents/controltorrent |\n| `POST` /unrestrict/link | `GET` /torrents/requestdl |\n\n### Dates\n\nAll dates returned from the API are normalized to UTC time. All dates are in the format:\n\n`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`\n\nExample: `2024-10-21T20:47:03Z` = The 21st of October, 2024 at 8:47:03 PM UTC.\n\nThis makes it easy for users and integrations to parse these dates and change them to the user's time zone for better UX. For more information on these formats, you can take a look at this [cheat sheet](https://strftime.org/).\n\n### SDK\n\nThere are many official and even non-official community created SDKs that wrap TorBox's API making it simple for developers to easily and quickly create applications using TorBox's API with their native programming language. There are already SDKs for the most popular languages and more are being added all the time!\n\n_Note: Being the official SDK does not mean you should use it over another SDK of the same language. There are some very impressive and highly updated SDKs!_\n\n| **Language** | **Project Link** | **Official** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Python | [https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-py](https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-py) | **YES** |\n| Python | [https://github.com/eliasbenb/TorBox.py](https://github.com/eliasbenb/TorBox.py) | **NO** |\n| Javascript/Typescript | [https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-js](https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-js) | **YES** |\n| Javascript/Typescript | [https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-torbox-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-torbox-api) | **NO** |\n| Go | [https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-go](https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-go) | **YES** |\n| C# | [https://github.com/asylumexp/TorBox.NET](https://github.com/asylumexp/TorBox.NET) | **NO** |",

This prevents long term link sharing.\n\n### Permalinks\n\nInstead of generating many CDN urls by requesting this endpoint, you can instead create a permalink such as: `https://api.torbox.app/v1/api/torrents/requestdl?token=APIKEY&torrent_id=NUMBER&file_id=NUMBER&redirect=true` and when a user clicks on it, it will automatically redirect them to the CDN link. This saves requests and doesn't abuse the API. Use this method rather than saving CDN links as they are not permanent.

Once they have been checked, they will begin downloading assuming your account has available active download slots, and they aren't too large.\n\n#### Post Processing Options:\n\nAll post processing options that the Usenet client will perform before TorBox's own processing to make the files available. It is recommended you either don't send this parameter, or keep it at `-1` for default, which will give only the wanted files.\n\n- `-1`, Default. This runs repairs, and extractions as well as deletes the source files leaving only the wanted downloaded files.\n    \n- `0`, None. No post-processing at all. Just download all the files (including all PAR2). TorBox will still do its normal processing to make the download available, but no repairs, or extraction will take place.\n    \n- `1`, Repair. Download files and do a PAR2 verification. If the verification fails, download more PAR2 files and attempt to repair the files.\n    \n- `2`, Repair and Unpack. Download all files, do a PAR2 verification and unpack the files. The final folder will also include the RAR and ZIP files.\n    \n- `3`, Repair, Unpack and Delete. Download all files, do a PAR2 verification, unpack the files to the final folder and delete the source files.\n    \n\n### Authorization\n\nRequires an API key using the Authorization Bearer Header."

This endpoint opens the link for 3 hours for downloads. Once a download is started, the user has nearly unlilimited time to download the file. The 1 hour time limit is simply for starting downloads. This prevents long term link sharing.\n\n### Permalinks\n\nInstead of generating many CDN urls by requesting this endpoint, you can instead create a permalink such as: `https://api.torbox.app/v1/api/torrents/requestdl?token=APIKEY&torrent_id=NUMBER&file_id=NUMBER&redirect=true` and when a user clicks on it, it will automatically redirect them to the CDN link. This saves requests and doesn't abuse the API. Use this method rather than saving CDN links as they are not permanent. To invalidate these permalinks, simply reset your API token or delete the item from your dashboard.\n\n### Authorization\n\nRequires an API key as a parameter for the `token` parameter."

						"description": "### Overview\n\nTakes in a list of comma separated usenet hashes and checks if the usenet download is cached. This endpoint only gets a max of around 100 at a time, due to http limits in queries. If you want to do more, you can simply do more hash queries. Such as:  \n`?hash=XXXX&hash=XXXX&hash=XXXX`\n\nor `?hash=XXXX,XXXX&hash=XXXX&hash=XXXX,XXXX`  \nand this will work too. Performance is very fast. Less than 1 second per 100. Time is approximately O(log n) time for those interested in taking it to its max. That is without caching as well. This endpoint stores a cache for an hour.\n\nYou may also pass a `format` parameter with the format you want the data in. Options are either `object` or `list`. You can view examples of both below.\n\nTo get the hash of a usenet download, pass the link or file through an md5 hash algo and it will return the proper hash for it. It should be noted that files will not be hashed the same as internally done, as we clean the file to dedupe.\n\n### Authorization\n\nRequires an API key using the Authorization Bearer Header."

It is usually a good idea to check this value before submitting a download to TorBox's servers for download.\n    \n- **Type** - values are either \"hoster\" or \"stream\". Both do the same thing, but is good to differentiate services used for different things.\n    \n- **Note** - a string value (or null) that may give helpful information about the current status or state of a hoster.

As a user submits links, once they hit this number, the API will deny them from adding anymore of this type of link.

This one can handle all file types.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added support for APKAdmin hoster.

This allows you to use Pro in full for 24 hours for only $1!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://checker.openwebtorrent.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;WebTorrent checker&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/tools&amp;quot;&amp;gt;tools page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as a direct link so users can quickly verify how many seeders and peers their torrent has. We will eventually be building this directly into the browser in the tools page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Notifications can now have actions!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Actions are buttons that do an action corresponding to what the notification is about. For example, if there was an error and you need to contact support to get it resolved, the action button will open the support modal to easily contact support. If a torrent finished downloading, it will give you a direct link to the download page of the files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This feature is extremely powerful, and we will be adding more actions corresponding with notifications in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cloud transfers, such as to Google Drive, OneDrive, 1Fichier, and GoFile can be cancelled in the middle of the transfer. This allows you to stop transferring at any point in the process and it won’t be uploaded to the cloud.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New background for metadata that cannot be found on the Your Media section. Not a lot of people will see the new background but it is awesome. You can find the image &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://stremio.torbox.app/background/fancy&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Put this as your wallpaper!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stream lists now show the tracker the search result was from. This is useful for determining what tracker or indexer it was from so you can make better decisions for choosing streams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stream lists now show if the file was from a user search engine or not. It will look like&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;TorBox (User Search) (Instant) (1080p)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; for a 1080p cached result from the user’s search engine. Pair this with the above tracker viewer, and you know exactly where a stream is from!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new error video plays when you are out of slots. This can happen periodically and to the average user it looks like there was a bug in TorBox, when really, their account is out of slots to download the torrent in the first place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Web Downloads/Debrid&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows downloading direct Buzzheavier links such as in the format &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;https://buzzheavier.com/dl/XXXXXX&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes downloading from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://Archive.org&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Archive.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

Previously it would look stuck as we didn’t have reliable status updates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Baidu downloads have been made more reliable. Links were getting stuck in storage filling it up, which no longer occurs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes MegaUp downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Mediafire downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes 1Fichier downloads with bad characters in the name (Non-UTF8).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cancelling in progress transfer jobs is possible now through the API. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://go.postman.co/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/documentation/29572726-4244cdaf-ece6-4b6d-a2ca-463a3af48f54?entity=request-50d0f0fa-f189-4883-9068-42a6937b59c6&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Submitting names to the API are now properly handled when creating Usenet and Web Downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Webhooks sent from the API to user’s configured webhook URL now use the title as the webhook type, such as “Download Ready” to “download.ready” for handling properly in webhooks. This will be documented soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Proper API messages when a free user submits their API key to the API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes some RSS feed links which download a .rss file, or a .xml file rather than returning the RSS feed data directly as content.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Subscriptions with Patreon now fixed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet files are now normalized to allow for usenet files to be properly cached. When an NZB is added from the same tracker, and is the same file, even from different accounts, it will be cached if actually cached.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cloud transfers now are more reliable due to using CDN rather than “local storage” files, which can be slow, or have other issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More reliable processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes torrent ownership. If, for example, 2 users add the same torrent at the same time, one of the users will be the owner of the torrent, rather than duplicates being created. This lead to problems with the database and qBittorrent not being synced, especially with private torrents, where it is far more important.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cloud transfers should start sooner (instantly), rather than taking minutes or even hours to start due to sharing a queue with other high traffic queues, which could get stuck in the back for a long time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent updates should be more full on the dashboard with no issues with malformed data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2025-03-18T17:00:00Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v7.0</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v70</link>\n            <guid>67c5f27f4f58dc17612e4192</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added UI section labeled “Search” in the settings. This is where you can access the new Bring Your Own Indexer (BYOI as the community has been calling it) settings. This allows you to add your own indexers or trackers using the NZBHydra2, Jackett or Prowlarr self-hosted apps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This allows you to get personalized torrents and Usenet results from your own trackers, removing reliance on TorBox’s own search indexers and providers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also allows you to stream private torrents from apps like Stremio which use TorBox’s search engine. This is a never before seen feature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like mentioned, it works with torrents and Usenet and adding new search engines is very easy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It works using the API too, so you (and developers) don’t have to do anything extra to use it with existing apps that already use the TorBox Voyager search engine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows the available indexers that it will use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a manual switch in the Search settings for using the BYOI feature in Stremio, as not everyone may want it in Stremio, as it may create longer loading times. This is off by default.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a switch in the Stremio settings for using the legacy “Your Media” in the Stremio addon discover page. (More on this in the Stremio section).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a switch in the Stremio settings for sorting what type of streams are shown first. You can now choose whether you want Usenet or torrent results first in the list.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a switch in the Integration settings for WebDAV labeled, “WebDAV Use Local Files”. This allows you to use the CDN, or not when downloading from the WebDAV. Depending on how you use the WebDAV service, it may be necessary to enable this setting. More information can be found on the settings page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed mass deleting queued downloads in the settings page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds back Crypto payments which are now being processed through &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://NowPayments.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;NowPayments.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; due to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://Sellix.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sellix.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; being taken down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dashboard now properly updates when you “Stop Seeding” a torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added clarification about per link size limits on the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/hosters&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Hosters page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Makes it easier to long tap on an item on the dashboard for iOS mobile devices which wanted to select text rather than hold on an item. It will now show the context menu more reliably.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All downloads now show a distinguished “Cached XXX ago” and “Created XXX ago”. This is to better tell how long ago an item was cached, while also not messing up the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Stremio addon can use the BYOI feature recently introduced. Make sure you enable it in the settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New “Your Media” section (discover page).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This now shows posters relating to the media rather than basic TorBox posters with text.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Multiple media downloads which relate to the same media will be placed together in the Your Media section. When clicking on a Your Media item, it will now show the proper listing for content based on Season and Episode (if TV) or list the watchable files inside of the media download if a movie.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It now shows full metadata for download items including year, description and even rating.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RE-INSTALL YOUR TORBOX STREMIO ADDON TO WORK PROPERLY.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Your Media” in the stream selection page is now more reliable and works even if the torrent/Usenet files are not named properly, it will still match in most cases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now sort by torrent or Usenet in the streams selection page. This allows you to show either torrents or Usenet downloads first. This can be useful, especially for Pro users who only want to stream Usenet downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The addon now uses CDN selection when streaming. Previously it only used the EU when streaming if on the default (Auto) setting. Setting manually used the CDN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better streaming performance, less buffering, and shorter start times for most users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Play next episode now works properly in the addon allowing users to get the Stremio popup for getting the next episode, even inside of “Your Media” listings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet items now properly show as cached if another user has them cached.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speed improvements regarding listing files. It no longer requires the filesystem to list files meaning it is very quick due to using the database only. Users with large libraries should no longer time out when viewing their files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows using the CDN when downloading files. This increases reliability, and heavily increases download speed especially for users requiring a CDN to download quickly. This makes streaming over the WebDAV insanely quick now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your may get 429 errors when downloading large folders. This is due to the connection limit and request speed when downloading many files at the same time from our CDN which is rate limited and connection limited. We recommend sticking to 1 connection in these cases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The search API now includes Torrentio when searching for torrents via ID. Torentio has many good sources and is very fast, so it is being used as a backup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Parameter to enable user search engines when searching the API, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;search_user_engines&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. This will increase the amount of time taken (as you are waiting for responses from more places, and disable caching on any results. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/sgwtp70/get-torrent-data?tab=params&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This uses the user’s search engines which they have configured in their settings to search for the torrents/Usenet requests you specify.

Even large downloads with hundreds of files and folders will start downloading relatively quickly and at good speeds.

All new downloads will go to the US CDN as well as the EU CDN as replication.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RSS Feeds now properly update based off of the time given.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet and Web Downloads will now be queued if you are out of active slots to be downloaded later.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Notifications will now tell the reason why a Usenet download failed inside of the message.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better payment errors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro users are now able to add downloads up to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;1TB&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in size from the previous 500GB!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download links are now valid for 3 hours before expiry rather than 1 hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes some torrents still seeding when added through the Stremio addon if the user’s option is set to “Never”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Properly sends an email when the user’s account is deleted to confirm deletion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cached web downloads will not show download progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeding torrents properly stop seeding at (or near) their specified seeding time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The API now distinguishes a “cached_at” date and a “created_at” date. The “cached_at” date is to determine how long ago an item was cached, while “created_at” determines when a download was added to a user’s account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;FTP&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes some filenames not showing properly and creating a recursive file structure due to not detecting it is a file/folder properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2025-03-03T18:18:39Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v6.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v62</link>\n            <guid>67998a137f291833e29a735a</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Since we re-did RSS feeds, we also had to redo queued downloads as those were also becoming a problem, especially with the increase in new queued downloads (over 1 million), and at the beginning I (Wamy) did not foresee millions of records in a single table, so there became many issues which sprung about due to not being optimized for said millions of records. Luckily the fixes were somewhat simple, and the new features easy to add.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability for different types of queued downloads to show up. This includes Usenet and even web downloads being able to be queued. Previously these would simply error, now they can be queued and used just as before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Queued downloads will be added on time (every hour), as before they would get delayed by minutes, hours and even days, which is not a good experience, especially if you have open slots you want to use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;SDK&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updates all SDKs to the latest version to reflect changes in the API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://pypi.org/project/torbox-api/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Python&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@torbox/torbox-api&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Typescript/Javascript&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.0.2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Go&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BREAKING CHANGE&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Removes the queued downloads routes at &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/controlqueued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/getqueued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. This was due to queued items needing their own route, rather than only being limited to the torrents endpoint. The routes are practically the same with a little more options, so if you are using these endpoints (basically nobody), then you can simply change the route and it will be all good!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces a new route, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/queued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, which is where queued endpoints will now live. This is to allow future expansion, and stop any possible confusion when wanting to use queued Usenet downloads or web downloads for example. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/folder/29572726-9822ca28-d124-4ebb-b09f-cd1098e5f38a?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Docs for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/controlqueued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; moved. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-097e3b5d-c34d-449a-b26b-603ed3e6f6fe?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Docs for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/getqueued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; moved. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-2e9b7b90-5544-478d-8744-e04543f4f0b8?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the “as_queued” parameter when creating a Usenet download.

This update is specific to the RSS feed system, which has been left untouched for quite some time now. We have been going through and listening to what our users have been wanting, and an improved RSS feed system has been something that has been desperately needed. In short, we added compatibility with Usenet and web download RSS feeds, better reliability, and more status views so you (and us) can see exactly what is wrong with your RSS feed should issues arise! Read the specific details below.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds new RSS feed UI, which allows you to view all of the RSS feed items associated with an RSS feed. This allows you to view what has been scraped, downloaded, or what has been errored out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also click on the name for each item and get the associated file from the RSS feed source.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds RSS feed status UI, allowing you to see exactly what is happening with your RSS feed at that exact moment, as well as see any possible issues that TorBox has had while scraping or downloading your RSS feed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The RSS feeds page has been updated and now shows a bunch of new information, and auto updates, and is highly responsive with changes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now specify 2 new options when editing or adding a new RSS feed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now specify the RSS Feed Download Type being a torrent, usenet, or web download RSS feed. This allows you to choose how scraped items are added to your TorBox account based on the RSS feed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the RSS feed type is of torrent, you can specify seeding settings, which are the same as the standard torrent seeding settings. This allows you to choose, per RSS feed, if they seed or not. This can be helpful for adding a lot of items at a time to the cache, or if you are adding from a private tracker for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Completely rewritten RSS feeds with compatibility with Usenet, and even web downloads!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This rewrite (should be taken lightly) adds a ton of new features and makes it easier to see what exactly is going on with your RSS feed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also makes it so that it actually scrapes on time, rather than being delayed for minutes or even hours at a time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RSS feeds now allow you to view their associated items, meaning that you can easily view and possibly debug any issues with an RSS feed and its items. Every item comes with a status and a status message.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New endpoints for retrieving RSS feeds and their associated items. This allows you to fully use and control RSS feeds now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Get RSS feeds allows you to get all of a user’s RSS feeds associated with their account. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-1624cad4-28fd-4bb0-934d-2246d1810cbc?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Get RSS feed items allows you to get the latest 10,000 RSS items associated with an RSS feed. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-5e2946d4-bfc8-4d0c-94c1-399c35b7cefa?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Generally better docs for RSS feeds, as many of the docs were missing helpful information.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2025-01-28T04:01:55Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v6.0</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v60</link>\n            <guid>67625116efd6ea319ceb6fa8</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Wow, writing this, I don’t even know where to begin. Version 6 of TorBox has been something that we have been desperately needing, and with our recent explosion of users, something that has been even more necessary. Our last change log was v5.0, on November 10th, 2024, which as of posting this update has been over 3 months ago. So much has happened in the past few months. Just because no updates have been posted, doesn’t mean we haven’t been just twiddling our thumbs like some people think.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds searching to integrations page. This makes it much easier to find the integration(s) you are looking for!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds CDN selection settings in the settings page under Integration Settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Integration Settings tab on mobile displays being centered.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds confirmation when attempting to cancel a subscription.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows users to manage subscriptions by clicking “Manage Subscription”, which takes you to the correct place to manage your subscription.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now view all of your previous TorBox transactions under the Account section of the settings page, labeled “Past Transactions”.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hosters page for viewing the current status of our newly rewritten hosters system. This is dynamic and updates every 30 seconds, and always has the most current information.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also search this page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dashboard now updates properly and is much more responsive, including deletions, additions and &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://updates.to&amp;quot;&amp;gt;updates.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Relay&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The relay was rewritten internally to better handle the load of thousands of torrents all getting updates at the same time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Previously the client (the website or other application) was responsible for requesting updates from the qBittorrent. Once you had thousands of requests going to only a few dozen nodes every single second, things got overloaded quickly, and as a result, it looked like downloads never started or were extremely slow, even if they were downloading lightning fast.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead we now have a dedicated process that uses what the qBittorrent webUI uses called Sync. It massively reduces the load on both the database and the servers themselves by only getting the updated data of the torrent, rather than the entire torrent object which was bandwidth and time costly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Telegram Bot&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By sending &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/subscribe&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to the Telegram bot, you can now pay for a TorBox subscription using Telegram Stars as a payment method. Telegram Stars can be purchased directly from Telegram using a debit or credit card, Apple Pay or Google pay wherever you use the Telegram app. This allows users who may not be able to pay with standard methods, to be able to pay for and use a premium TorBox subscription.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows privacy emails such as those from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://duck.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;duck.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://simplelogin.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;simplelogin.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This was previously blocked due to an API change from our email checking provider.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The speed test servers have been re-enabled. These were disabled previously to prevent additional load on the servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Payments are now given 31 days, rather than 30 to account for all months. This was causing users who paid in December to have their accounts lapse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Completely rewritten our Hosters system rather than using JDownloader2 internally. We love JDownloader2 and use it personally, but it has scale issues which required us to completely do a 180 turn and write an API from the ground up, which allows us so much flexibility, and keeps us from relying on a 3rd party to keep our services running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With this change we have already rolled out some of the most popular hosters available, as well as ones that have never before been seen on any debrid service!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New servers and networking now makes seeding and downloading much better and faster due to changes in network allowing torrents to find peers much faster and more than previously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes to our routing system and how CDN and files are found on our servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This completely removes any issues with propagation across servers and waiting for files to be available on all servers. Instead the API will calculate and find the closest server to you (or your selected CDN) if it has the file. Otherwise it will just pick the only server with the file.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also allows more direct connections as we send you to the exact server with the file, rather than possibly proxying the file across servers, introducing unreliability and slower speeds than what is technically possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This allows us more flexibility as well as helps in debugging, as every link is the same. If, for example, you run into slow speeds, you can simply send us the link and we know exactly what server is having the issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A dynamic and updating debrid hoster list has been made public for apps use. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-0a17f8b0-87a1-459c-b2d9-32d34b00c2ae?action=share&amp;amp;amp;source=copy-link&amp;amp;amp;creator=29572726&amp;amp;amp;ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; This can be used for status pages and the like. One has already been implemented on our Discord server using this API. Thanks Midnight!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CDN selection from settings overrides all settings passed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download links are cached in memory for a short period of time after creation to reduce time of the request down about 80%! These savings are also passed onto everything that requests a download links from the API saving time for all requests after the first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thanks to one of our developers, Runage, discovered that Stremio creates a new request to the API everytime you seek or click the play button on a piece of media. Runage advised us to cache the download link inside of the Stremio addon, so that if a user seeks or resumes media, it can be extremely fast. We have implemented this, and seeking is now much faster!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are in the process of completely rewriting our Stremio addon to be the fastest and most feature complete addon available!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-12-18T04:35:34Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v5.0</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v50</link>\n            <guid>673129791013f5034bebef47</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Users now get rate limit errors when adding too much via the Dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Virtualizes search results list so that there is no lag when searches return a lot of results (&amp;amp;gt;200).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds referral data to subscriptions page so you can see:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The number of referred accounts that currently use your code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total number of purchases your referrals have made using your code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total number of days earned by your referrals using your code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The total amount of money or value you have theoretically saved by referring.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows success notification when deleting an item from the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Puts integrations page behind authentication meaning you have to be logged in to view it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes wording of a lot of sections on the main pages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes not all search results showing on search.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deleting an account now requires a confirmation code to be entered which prevents accidental deletions. This was a highly requested and extremely necessary fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brand new settings page layout!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds subscription section to account settings section so that you can manage your subscriptions right from the TorBox website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds section for deleting all of your TorBox downloads. Good to purge your account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;API now returns normalized dates in the format: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. Previously, this was causing issues with some integrations having to write custom parsers as TorBox would include nanoseconds in response times. This also standardizes the entire API to use UTC time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds remark about dates on &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/collection/gf4oxv0/main-api&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Main API docs.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updates rate limiting for creating downloads.

This information can be found at the new route &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/users/referraldata&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can send an IP to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/xxx/requestdl&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; routes using the parameter &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;user_ip&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which will allow you to basically choose the CDN that your user will receive. This is useful for integrations where a main API is making all of the requests, but you still want the user to use the CDN. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/lrz8fwd/request-download-link?tab=params&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the routes &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/xxx/mylist&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; the API only returns a 404 for empty requests if the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;id&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter is given.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BREAKING CHANGE&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: On the routes &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/xxx/checkcached&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; the API now returns an empty object or list if the cache returns nothing. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(Yes we will be keeping this endpoint, it’s not going anywhere)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Baidu, Twitch, and HexUpload to supported in JDownloader2.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upped rate limits to 60/hour for all creation endpoints (&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/createtorrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, etc).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now request confirmation codes for all sorts of future uses.

If the file meets all of the criteria, it will be available to download from &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage-hyperdrive.west.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Users in the eastern side of the world (Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, China, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, etc) now also get access to our new CDN system. if the file meets all of the criteria, it will be available to download from &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage-hyperdrive.apac.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are also throwing countries such as New Zealand, Australia in this list for the time being as they users in these countries will benefit from the APAC region (as it’s closer than the EU).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This does not affect download speeds for files served over WebDAV, FTP, Tinfoil, or any other download method not part of our web storage system (&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also does not affect zip downloads such as those from &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage-zip.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is completely automatic, and already works with all integrations that use the request download API endpoint, and is based on the client’s region as &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://developers.cloudflare.com/network/ip-geolocation/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;determined by Cloudflare&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are not in these regions, such as in the EU, you will still be served files from &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;, from our servers in the Netherlands, no CDN is needed for you!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Normal download speeds from TorBox should be much faster! We have noticed differences at about 10-15% increase (from &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;https://storage.torbox.app&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt; links).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The “file could not be retrieved” propagation error should be now completely eradicated! As soon as a download is marked as “Ready to Download” it will actually mean that, ready to download!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox now supports downloading from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://twitch.tv&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Twitch&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://pan.baidu.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Baidu&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;! Simply put in a Twitch or Baidu link (and an optional password), and it will download like normal (no status updates right now).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Much more reliable debrid downloads. Previously we were seeing failures at up to 30%, now we have seen it down to under 2%. Failures can be due to many different conditions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Faster debrid downloads. Downloads should now start downloading instantly. Previously there was a queue, and if there were a lot in front of yours it could take a long time to begin. We have now fixed this issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A standard notification is now sent after a purchase was made with a referral code to the user purchasing (the referee).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Storage files now reset their expiry every request to allow for things like pausing for an hour and such.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows more than 1000 torrents to be requested at one time, up to 10000. This allows you to show 10000 on the webdav.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better reliability during processing to reduce failed transfers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Payment confirmations now have a dedicated email so that you know for sure your payment has been processed (along with the standard notifications).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents are now checked for illicit content, such as CSAM.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A dedicated email is now sent when your account is deleted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enables limits for specific debrid hosters. This allows for us to better manage abuse of our systems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Slightly optimizes searching speeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent searches now includes searches from Zilean.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;FTP&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes logging into FTP with capitalization in the email.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent searches now include data from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://debridmediamanager.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;DebridMediaManager&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, thanks to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/iPromKnight/zilean&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Zilean.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Discord Bot&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Discord bot is now a Discord verified bot!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Speed Test&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The speed test page now includes test files for the US and Singapore CDN’s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-11-10T21:45:29Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.9.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v491</link>\n            <guid>67272e016a8e3ea20ea7d688</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searches by query should be a lot more accurate when searching titles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Optimized the dashboard to reduce lag with dashboards that have a lot of downloads that get updates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds referral banner on subscription page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better explanation of referrals on the subscription page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds TorBox partners site to footer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/MunifTanjim/stremthru&amp;quot;&amp;gt;StremThru&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Integration to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/integrations&amp;quot;&amp;gt;integrations page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds setup guide for Kodi POV addon to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/mylist&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; endpoints, if there are no results for the request parameters, it will give a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;404&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; with a specific error, instead of a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;200&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and success response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds new Vendors API.

We listened to your complaints, feature requests and issues, and decided to fix and implement nearly every one of them! The biggest feature request so far has been our search. Lately you would have a hard time finding exactly what you needed, with the biggest issue being by far, the torrent search. We decided to team up with Orion, who specializes in exactly that, to provide our searches for us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Your Media” in stream list selects all files that match, rather than just the first, which led to issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes double (and triple) adding of torrents and Usenet downloads inside of the Stremio addon! This was an issue that affected nearly every addition of non-instant downloads, and was taking up a slot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For those of you curious, the issue was that Stremio always sends a &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;HEAD&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; request when getting video (for getting pre-loaded information about the file), which was interpreted in our Stremio Addon as requesting the video over again. We simply deny &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;HEAD&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; requests and it works fine. Stremio will still work without the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;HEAD&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; requests as the video information is delivered on success of the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;GET&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; request (which we actually care about).

This is helpful for monitoring their progress, as they used to only show 0% until completion or failure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed VLC “Open In Player” option due to the lack of deep linking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hides Stremio “Open In Player” option on mobile devices due to it not being supported on mobile, only desktop.

This is due to the cost and quality of Orionoid, and our partnership with them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searches now show if the torrents are cached, right in the UI meaning you can pick instantly ready to download files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searches now also show if you already have the file in your TorBox account. This makes picking new downloads much easier and takes out the guesswork.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes Dropbox integration due to production level status requiring approval.

Orion (or Orionoid) is a link provider which provides high quality magnet links, .torrent file downloads, and .nzb file downloads, with over 109 Million links in their database to search from all part of your paid TorBox plan!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means much faster search speeds, much higher quality results, and better sorting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;BREAKING CHANGE:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Meta search changed endpoint locations to &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/meta/search&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, following the structure of the following new endpoints.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet search allows you to search by query at &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/usenet/search&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.

This is due to wanting to consolidate all searching to a single API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows requesting to download a download as a .torrent file. Simply passing the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;torrent_file&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter will download the requested file as a .torrent file, for use anywhere. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/lrz8fwd/request-download-link&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;all&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter when controlling downloads (deleting, re announcing, etc) will &amp;lt;u&amp;gt;queue&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt; the operation, due to the amount of time required to process all of a user’s downloads.

This is useful if you just want to queue up a few torrents over a few requests. You can send the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;as_queued&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter to &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/createtorrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and it will be added as queued. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-062b717f-4866-4fc0-a3e6-6e4c2520eefa?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-10-23T17:25:49Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.8</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v48</link>\n            <guid>6716b430a160865a6521722b</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds link back to Login page on Forgot Password page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows sorting on the dashboard! The following are options and what they do:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Default is the default option. It shows newest at the top, with inactive and cached at the bottom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Newest puts the newest items (created time) at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oldest does the opposite, putting oldest items (created time) at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Last Updated puts the most recently updated at the top. This is good for watching active downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A to Z sorts from A to Z, pretty simple.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Z to A sorts opposite of the above.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows filtering on the dashboard. You can filter by preset filters or by searching for a name or a file name, which was a highly requested feature. It also resolves &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.featurebase.app/p/tabs-for-torrents-and-usenet-downloads&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Can filter by Usenet Downloads, Web Downloads, Torrents, Cached, Inactive, Download Ready, Active, Downloading, and Uploading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching is a fuzzy search, and likely still needs some tuning, so if you run into any issues, especially with Kanji or Chinese characters, please let us know!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching should be performant enough, but if you run into any issues, such as with a large list with a lot of files, please let us know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sort and filter added to the settings so that you can set your account to have a default, if you don’t like the current defaults. Changing from the dashboard won’t override your settings in the settings page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better error messages when adding torrents, Usenet and web downloads. Previously the generic errors were confusing users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Various style changes to front page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Redesigned Avatar panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Redesigned More Info panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes arrow for CTA enabled site-wide announcements.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed “Your Media” showing non-video files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox no longer selects cached torrents from other user’s accounts. If the torrent is actually cached, then it won’t use a slot. Previously even if the torrent was cached, it used a slot on every account that added the torrent. Now, cached torrents won’t use a slot, regardless. Resolves &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.featurebase.app/p/torrent-added-by-another-user-should-not-take-my-slot&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox now checks for file size on &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;.torrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; files, prior to adding to the client. Previously this would cause issues with users downloading too large of torrents from private trackers costing a lot of download quota, and counting as a leech.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This won’t be done for magnet links due to the time it takes to figure out the real size of the torrent before adding to a client, since it requires contact with the network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upgraded all servers to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;qBittorrent v5.0.0&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. We required API’s from their most recent update which was not available on older versions (previously v4.6.1). This should also bring more benefits such as security, and speed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;General service stability fixes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;offset&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;limit&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameters to all &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/mylist&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; routes. This means that pagination is possible for users with over 1000 (the default limit) downloads to get all of their downloads in a few requests rather than not at all. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/9ka6t2x/get-torrent-list&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes cached &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/torrentinfo&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; data showing entire request response.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-10-21T20:06:08Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.7.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v474</link>\n            <guid>670e17d8023c25b144fa7124</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Account statistics properly update hourly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox now scans for viruses on commonly infected file types.

Options are:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seeders/Age, sorts by most seeds or youngest (if Usenet). This is the default option.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Size, sorts by largest first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resolution, sorts by best resolution first.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes mobile notifications settings, and mobile app buttons from website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes TorBox mobile app from integrations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now set custom sorting settings for the addon. You can now sort by highest seeders (which is the default), size, and resolution. This was a highly requested feature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cached items (Instant) are always sorted by resolution, showing the highest at the top, regardless of sorting.

It was out of date, had many bugs, and nearly nobody used the app (Only had about 1,300 installs). This was an executive decision due to time spent developing mobile apps being very high. We want to spend more time on real features that everyone will use, rather than only a very small portion of our users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-10-15T07:20:56Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.7.3</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v473</link>\n            <guid>6709d3fd57192756e4a30c81</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes look of subscription page on mobile devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes look of login page when keyboard is active on mobile devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes centering of buttons on login page on mobile devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds details to Usenet downloads when they go inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes pause and resume buttons from Usenet and torrent downloads on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes deleting queued downloads from the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made notification, profile, and additional items popup tabs match the width of the entire set of buttons making it look much better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes ability to purchase long term storage addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes the long term storage addon. This was a voted decision due to costs and abuse of the addon. We never intended for the addon to be used for hoarding, which is what it introduced, which TorBox is not in a position to allow right now. This addon will be revisited in the future as it was very popular.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes the ability to pause Usenet and torrents.

You can view the below graph types:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Downloads&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Number of downloads over the last 30 days. This includes torrents, Usenet and web downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Users&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Number of users over the last 30 days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Satellites&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Number of available downloading servers over the last 30 days&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Downloaded Bandwidth&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Total amount of ingress bandwidth over the last 30 days. Includes torrents, Usenet and web downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Seeded Bandwidth&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Total amount of egress bandwidth spent on seeding torrents, whether public or private.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Total Egress Bandwidth&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; - Total amount of egress bandwidth spent on serving files to users, whether streamed or download. Does not include bandwidth spent from WebDAV or FTP.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Referral Link&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; copy button to profile menu. This was done for easier finding of it, since a lot of our users didn’t know where to find it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds referral section to settings page. Same with the reasoning to add it to the profile menu, since it was hard to find.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds button to copy code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds button to copy link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds API key to localStorage, for making use with future webapps and extensions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New statistic, Total Egress Bandwidth. Like said above, it is the total amount of egress bandwidth spent on serving files to users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows running operations on all torrents, queued torrents, web downloads, and Usenet downloads. You can now send the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;all=true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter, without requiring a single id. This is useful for batch operations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents → &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/igz4oad/control-torrent?ctx=documentation&amp;amp;amp;tab=body&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Queued Torrents → &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/dhdfu8t/control-queued-torrent?ctx=documentation&amp;amp;amp;tab=body&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Web Downloads → &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-151c9e58-16ca-4e44-91b0-6192fddc5e32?ctx=documentation&amp;amp;amp;tab=body&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet Downloads → &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-39a94784-ff64-4387-80e1-b7cfb1232dbe?ctx=documentation&amp;amp;amp;tab=body&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-09-10T05:21:12Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.6.5</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v465</link>\n            <guid>66da22825b1147d04ecb70cc</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated styling of WebDAV UI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Speed Test&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated styling of Speed Test UI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds delete account button to website, this was highly requested. Requires you to hold down on the button for at least 1 second to delete.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds live service status to the footer of every page (with a footer). This is useful for checking at a glance if something is wrong or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Switches from Chatwoot support to Intercom support. This comes with a lot of perks, mostly for us at TorBox, but also for the users as this will now include AI answers that can possibly answer your questions faster than a support agent could.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new and beautiful help center with better accessibility and ease of use. You are now properly able to search for answers to common issues. The AI is also trained using these articles, so ask the AI questions!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes help center links to new help center on Intercom.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-09-08T06:56:08Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.6.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v464</link>\n            <guid>66d77ac3561407bd2f0b599a</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reduced prices of active slots addons by around half! This means for those of you interested in seeding a lot, or mass downloading, it is much more accessible!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;5 Additional Slots reduced from $3 → $2&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;10 Additional Slots reduced from $6 → $3&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;25 Additional Slots reduced from $15 → $8&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember, these stack meaning you can subscribe to multiple and they will add up properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better detection of NZB names. This reduces your chances of getting an annoying &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Unknown NZB&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; name. When using links, such as from search, it will use headers from the download of the link to get an NZB name. Usually the names of downloads are in the headers of the links, so we are now using those to piece together information.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better size detection of completed usenet downloads. Before, a lot of downloads would show 0B for no size. This will get the most accurate sizing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better size detection of completed web downloads. Same with Usenet, a lot of downloads would show 1B or 0B for no size. TorBox will now show the accurate size of the download after processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Avatar section now shows your max allowed concurrent active slots.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Avatar section now shows your enabled addons, such as the Long Term Seeding addon, as well as the Long Term Storage addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes drop down icon which appears on smaller screens to use new icon format. Also fixes the weird spacing in between the drop down button and the torrent button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Stremio addon now shows web downloads inside of “Your Media”. If you downloads some media using the TorBox web downloader, it will now show up in Stremio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Stremio addon now searches for web downloads when clicking on streams. If you have any web downloads in your account, which match the title of the media you are trying to find a stream for, it will now use web downloads along with torrents and usenet downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-09-05T06:32:43Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.6.3</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v463</link>\n            <guid>66c250815b8d88a1b740f9f7</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Settings inputs are properly de-bounced so you don’t get a notification on every single modification.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed mentions of VPN and removed tool to download the VPN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disabled registering for VPN. Cloudflare Warp has removed referral access so no new accounts can be created using it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Emails are even more beautiful now!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We had to deal with a lot of challenges such as supporting different email clients, looking good over standard HTML, plaintext and every other way email can be displayed, as well as the standardization (or lack thereof) of email clients not supporting special fonts, etc. Most elements on the email are actually just rendered images to get the look we wanted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes issues with eTags. We simply removed them, as well as last modified headers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows getting queued downloads, and information about them. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-097e3b5d-c34d-449a-b26b-603ed3e6f6fe&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-08-31T20:24:02Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.6.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v462</link>\n            <guid>66bbbfdaa4fc8bb23e342930</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed magic links. They were an anti user experience feature, and caused more trouble than they were worth. All new sign ups will be done with standard email and password. Most users also set a password right after signing up, so this reduces time spent setting up your account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Invalid and disposable emails are now rejected in a more reasonable way. While signing up, you will get a notification if the email is invalid or disposable. New requirements are as follows:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Must have valid MX records for receiving mail.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Must be a valid domain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Must not currently be in use by another user (this also includes duplicate emails employing the “+” and “.” trick).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Passwords are now required to be very strong, right from the start. This will improve site security and reduce risk for TorBox. Requirements are as follows:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One lower case letter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One upper case letter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One number.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One special character.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not part of any &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords&amp;quot;&amp;gt;haveibeenpwned&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; databases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not a common password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Errors are now properly given and sign ups are a lot easier to go through.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Magnet links have better regex and form validation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Copy batch links and zip download icons have brand green loading icons rather than white.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Redesigned emails. They are a lot better looking and will still receive improvements over time, as we have developed our own email UI and framework for easily creating and modifying emails.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Logging in now requires the API, so if the API is slow or down, then logging in won’t be possible.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: If you previously used magic email to sign in and never set a password, you must get a reset password email, by going to &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/forgotpw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;https://torbox.app/forgotpw&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-08-13T20:35:27Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.6.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v461</link>\n            <guid>66b46203e849cf6336b44595</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes “&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;controlusenetdownload&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;” route name.

Say hello to our new icons and font! The icons are all custom and handmade to fit TorBox perfectly, and the font is uniquely special to TorBox as well as the matching “Dotted Icons” (we don’t really know what to call them).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If we had the time, we would tell you all about our design choices, all the different icons, etc, but you will have to discover all of them yourself!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/01911134-a2e7-7363-bedc-193c5ee09f78.png&amp;quot; data-width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot; data-align=&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the dashboard, all downloads are given a tag which tells you exactly what they are, whether torrents, web downloads, or usenet downloads, there is no more guessing which is which!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better sorting of downloads on the dashboard. We got a lot of feedback that new downloads were hard to find, or that they had to scroll halfway through the page, just to view the download. Currently we are sorting by newest, as well as giving some weight to active downloads being at the top, and inactive at the bottom. Soon this will be customizable as well as filterable!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed notification message copying the title instead of the message.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Queued torrents are now checked after the manual “Stop Seeding” control action is called. Previously, only deleted torrents did this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The service and APIs should be much more stable. We have changed our infrastructure once again, and we are hoping this provider will be able to meet our needs. We are very confident!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated Infrastructure Status page to show newest servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DOWNLOAD001, DOWNLOAD002, and DOWNLOAD004 were put out of commission due to slow networking performance by the provider. DOWNLOAD003 was kept due to the good deal. &amp;lt;span data-name=&amp;quot;grin&amp;quot; data-type=&amp;quot;emoji&amp;quot;&amp;gt;😁&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FTP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes compatibility with RClone.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;u&amp;gt;There is a known issue with Infuse not working with FTP&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;. It will constantly load, and no video will play. We recommend using the TorBox WebDAV instead.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes duplicated downloads being added on uncached streams.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Listing speed increases due to more optimized code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed bug where on first search, there would be little to no results, but when you came back, there would be more. First search now provides the same amount of results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed size and seeders have no value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed peers from description. Didn’t really matter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searches have way more results!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Streams now have much more accurate data. This includes language, resolution and quality. This is due to our fork of &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/TheBeastLT/parse-torrent-title&amp;quot;&amp;gt;TheBeastLT’s Parser&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (known and used for Torrentio Stremio Addon). We were previously using their parser for our own addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We were unhappy with the results, so thanks to help from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/dreulavelle/PTT/tree/main&amp;quot;&amp;gt;PTT by Dreulavelle&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, we have amazingly accurate data in the Stremio addon now!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I guess you can say that we are now better than Torrentio (even though we already were).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can view and even possibly contribute to the code &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/TorBox-App/parse-torrent-title&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-08-02T03:51:42Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.5</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v45</link>\n            <guid>668fa66ae834f6452aec64d7</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed service! Most downloads should be available to download. As of writing this changelog, we are still missing about 20TB of data, and about half of that is already located on the servers, we just have to &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;mv /old /new&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; , which unfortunately has to be done last, after the final 10 or so TB have been transferred from the old servers. All new downloads, anything seeding, and most cached downloads will be working. Over the next few weeks we are bringing all data back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our server are now all 10Gbit and downtime resilient!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download at nearly 10Gbit speeds as much as you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If one of our servers goes down, it only affects the files on that server, not the entire service. Before if any server went down, it would cause everything to fail, which is definitely not acceptable, when your fleet is 10+ servers large.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reliability patches and lots of bug fixes throughout. We can’t even list them all, or else no one would want to read the change log.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Discord Bot to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds new Telegram Bot to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds new &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/g0ldyy/comet&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Comet integration&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds ElfHosted to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Mega integration to integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds guides for West’s Blackhole script, Riven, Mediafusion, and Comet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability to enable or disable Telegram notifications from the new Discord bot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You must have your Telegram account linked for notifications to be delivered to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability to link your Telegram account to TorBox to be able to receive notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed username and password of Tinfoil server to use API key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes errors for integration uploads. Rather than giving you a generic error, it is detailed from the API, telling you exactly what went wrong, and a possible remedy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enables ability to transfer files to your Mega account! Before the button was just lurking there, ready to be used, and now it finally can be! Simply make sure you have your Mega credentials set in the TorBox settings and click the button!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mega uploads won’t show progress, just like 1Fichier and GoFile due to the way files are uploaded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently zips aren’t possible, due to the way they are uploaded, but there is a “beta” in the API if you still want to try it out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to add your Mega account to TorBox in the settings! Simply enter your credentials and click “Login to Mega” to save them. They will be encrypted and the next time your refresh the page, they will show encrypted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a button that allows you to delete your credentials when you have saved them previously.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like stated above, credentials are encrypted in AES-256, they don’t even hit our database until they are encrypted, so you can be sure that even if something drastic happened to our database, you Mega account will be safe.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Obviously both username, and password are required to use Mega.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tinfoil Server&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Tinfoil server now uses your API key for authentication. This is due to Tinfoil not correctly encoding data before it is sent leading to authentication issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Username will always be &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;torbox&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Password is now your API key.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also prevents password sharing as your API key is core to everything on TorBox, you can modify basically everything about an account using an API key, which should prevent mass sharing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Serving files should be more reliable. Before, we would base64 encode the path of the file, which would lead to buffering issues and encoding issues depending on the name of the file (Japanese characters would cause issues), so now we simply use ID’s for everything leading to near perfect reliability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Indexes are now encrypted. This prevents people from seeing the download links and potentially sharing them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Telegram Bot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces the TorBox Telegram Bot! A lot of people have been asking for this for awhile and it has been on the to do list for just as long, so we decided to give it a shot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bot was built using &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://grammy.dev/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://grammy.dev/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; meaning the process was insanely simple, and most of the code was taken from the Discord bot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are able to do all the same functions as in the Discord bot, just in Telegram, the privacy conscious chat platform.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The bot is very clean and simple to use, with simple commands, and a simple to use interface.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also receive notifications through the bot. The bot will simply send you a message whenever you get a notification, and it can act as a push notification to your mobile device if you don’t want Discord notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds plans number key to API docs. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-a3775d9b-f3ee-49cd-98a4-fc909ed2923b?tab=overview&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes cache check returning null if the hashes sent are not all lowercase. This allows for mixed type hashes to be sent now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-07-11T09:30:17Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v44</link>\n            <guid>668a002ba61df5c08391f70c</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a bit of a smaller update, but one that rounds most of the jagged edges TorBox has had for awhile, as well as introduces some pretty cool things. We would also like to apologize to everyone for the server issues we have been having recently, we desperately are trying to claw our way out of it, and right now, it is just a waiting game, as hardware is arriving. We hope to make it up to all of you, and maybe bring some of those who have unsubscribed from the service due to the issues (we miss you!). Anyways, please enjoy this update. We will create a new change log and site announcement when things are back up and running at 100%. We promise the wait will be worth it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability to download your files from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://tinfoil.io/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tinfoil&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;! No more need for scammy shops, &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/blawar/nut&amp;quot;&amp;gt;NUT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or clunky transfers! Simply input the TorBox Tinfoil Server connection details into your Tinfoil app and start directly installing to your Nintendo Switch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note that we don&amp;#x27;t provide games, or support piracy in any way. This is simply an easy way to transfer your owned files to your Nintendo Switch.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To connect, simply make sure you have &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;.nsp&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;.nsz&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;.xci&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;.xcz&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; files inside of your TorBox and open Tinfoil on your switch and use the connection details below:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Protocol: https&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Host: &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://tinfoil.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;tinfoil.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Username: Your TorBox email. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Make sure to replace the &amp;#x27;@&amp;#x27; symbol with &amp;#x27;%40&amp;#x27; as Tinfoil doesn&amp;#x27;t officially support emails when connecting.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Password: Your TorBox password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Name: TorBox&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You were previously able to use Tinfoil through the TorBox FTP, but this is simply another way to interact with your TorBox files from Tinfoil (as well as being easier).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You were also previously able to use Tinfoil with TorBox through Google Drive, but as it’s not automated, it makes it difficult, as well as the setup being generally difficult and somewhat time consuming. This is just a better way in almost every way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability for TorBox to send notifications over a webhook! This allows you to do a whole lot of interesting things with your notifications as soon as you receive them!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Discord and Slack are natively supported, simply add a webhook from either site and TorBox will recognize it and send you a fancy notification on the respective platform!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If not a known service, TorBox will simply send the following payload which is standard according to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Standard Webhooks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;{\n    &amp;quot;event&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;torbox.notification&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;timestamp&amp;quot;: utc_iso_time,\n    &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {\n        &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,\n        &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;\n    }\n}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Google Drive uploads and logins. Previously they would fail at 100% due to recent issues with our IP’s being incorrectly flagged on &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.spamhaus.org/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Spamhaus&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; due to rack neighbors. This issue has been solved for the most part, but it is likely still going to be an ongoing fight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Tinfoil as integration to the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/integrations&amp;quot;&amp;gt;integrations page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Wireguard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as integration to the integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://sabnzbd.org/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SABnzbd&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as integration to the integrations page as it works with the TorBox Usenet provider.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds RClone FTP as integration to the integrations page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Tinfoil Server to settings page, which shows all of the info necessary to connect to it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Usenet Provider to settings page, which takes you to the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/tools&amp;quot;&amp;gt;tools page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to actually get your credentials.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds ability to change whether you want to receive notifications inside of the JDownloader application &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(not yet implemented into the plugin)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds ability to view the tracker message, if any, when switching on viewing the tracker.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hides tracker sensitive information on dashboard, simply shows the host name of the tracker on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds ability to stop seeding a torrent. This is good for when you feel as though you have seeded enough, or simply want to recover a slot while still keeping the torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Webhook Notification setting to the settings page to determine if you want notifications sent to the given webhook url.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Webhook URL setting to the settings page, where notifications will be sent if enabled.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds a test notification settings button. This will simply create a notification in the standard way, to test your notification setup. It will only send a test notification to your enabled notification options. Useful if using webhook notifications and you want to make sure they work. This will not create test notifications for web notifications or RSS feed notifications (if enabled).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tinfoil Server&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Tinfoil server is introduced to TorBox services. This allows you to download your files directly from TorBox to your Tinfoil application.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have created an open source and self-hosted version of this API, which you can run for yourself, on your own computer or server. This releases the pressure from us to host this API for public consumption, so if we ever take down the Tinfoil server, you are able to host and run it yourself, and it will work exactly the same as the hosted version!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can view the GitHub repository for the open source server &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/TorBox-App/torbox-tinfoil-server&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can view the Docker container information &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/anonymoussystems/torbox-tinfoil-server&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will be continuously worked on as ideas form, as well as accepting PR’s and such.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Discord Bot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed reliability and made more robust.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows providing a name to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/createtorrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/usenet/createusenetdownload&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/webdl/createwebdownload&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; endpoints. This allows you to provide a custom name with your downloads, so it can be named as you like. This fixes issues with torrents having unknown names. This is currently not implemented on the website or in the Stremio addon. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;link&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-062b717f-4866-4fc0-a3e6-6e4c2520eefa?tab=body&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds the ability to send test notifications.

This was due to our notifications API we were using, and have since switched to the browser native Notifications API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/tools&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tools page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; has a new tool! You can now get your Usenet credentials for the TorBox provider (more below). This is simply an easy way to view your credentials and even reset them if needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Switches back from our 10gbit servers. They weren&amp;#x27;t ready for production, even after testing, and their performance wasn&amp;#x27;t enough regarding uploads to the servers. This lead to completed downloads erroring out due to the files not being uploaded fast enough. We have since moved back to our old servers and are working on higher performance servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox now offers the ability to use TorBox as a provider for downloading from the Usenet on your own server! For Pro users, you are able to generate an account to use on your favorite Usenet provider.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox offers 25 connections, SSL, and speeds up to 20gbit on almost all the major backbones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Host: &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://usenet.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;usenet.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Port: 563.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This feature is in beta, and not meant to be your main provider at this time. We are working on making this better, so it could possibly replace your Usenet providers!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-07-06T06:34:46Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.3.3</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v433</link>\n            <guid>66826745f14e2710170ca256</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FTP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes going more than 2 folders deep.

This means that in general, downloads from TorBox to your devices should be much faster in general. In our testing average download speed has doubled. Below is a screenshot of a transfer we got using a max connection limit of 16. Pretty quick!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1719823875351..jpg&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of TorBox storage servers are now fully encrypted. This means that the files on our servers are encrypted and combined with fully encrypted transfers over https, and SSL, you can be sure that no one will ever no what you are downloading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All API responses now include an &amp;quot;error&amp;quot; key.

Previously it was at about 7 seconds average, now it is at about 3 seconds average. This was due to preventing a lot of unnecessary calls to the database, and keeping pretty much all data in redis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-06-25T00:20:16Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.3</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v43</link>\n            <guid>6668d01d1b88339c442e2b3b</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a pretty large update with a lot of quality of life changes, as well as some missing additions to already existing features. The biggest things to mention are all the new integrations that TorBox now has. You are now able to upload your files directly to Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox, 1Fichier, GoFile, and soon Mega. You are now also able to add links directly to JDownloader2. Along with uploading and downloading files, we now have a JDownloader2 plugin! Thank you to the JDownloader2 team for creating this! There are a ton of other new integrations that we will go over below. This is also a &amp;quot;Fix everything&amp;quot; version. We fixed so many glaring issues with the service, which we are very happy about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes &amp;quot;Open in Player&amp;quot; button to show the drop down properly on all devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes &amp;quot;Open in Stremio&amp;quot; button not working properly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes &amp;quot;Open in Download Manager&amp;quot; button to &amp;quot;Copy Link&amp;quot; button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes links properly copying on Firefox and Safari browsers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes look and feel of notification popups. They now group up and show on top of each other. This change saved us over 1000 lines of code in total, across the entire website, and it is a lot simpler for us to now make changes to the look and feel of notification popups. More work will be done on these in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to pass a password to the debrid. You can now download files with passwords from hosters. Of course, this is optional for files not requiring a password.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes quick add page not adding torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes look of download buttons on the download page. Shows status of transfers on the button depending on the download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568130225..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to download a file directly to JDownloader. On the download page, simply click the &amp;quot;Add to JDownloader&amp;quot; button, and it will open JDownloader2 (assuming the application is already open on your computer) and will prompt you asking if you want to add the link. This button saves you a step, rather than clicking on Copy Link, opening the app, and going through all the steps, this is a simple button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google Drive, Onedrive, and Dropbox integrations are a lot more simplified.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Google Drive, it will work mostly the same, simply click &amp;quot;Add to Google Drive&amp;quot; and it will open a popup (or new window/tab) asking you to choose an account, and give permissions to TorBox to access your Drive. It will then begin uploading to Google Drive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Onedrive, the process has been simplified greatly. Before, you had to (for some reason) click and log in multiple times. This time around, it&amp;#x27;s a single login, like it should have been.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For Dropbox, this is the biggest change, login is simplified, like all the others. You no longer can select a folder like before, it simply uploads everything to it&amp;#x27;s own &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://TorBox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;TorBox.app&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; folder. While some might not appreciate this, it allows all files to be organized where they came from. The other big change is that it no longer requires you to upload the file using your own internet. Before, your internet acted as a proxy that downloaded from TorBox, and uploaded to Dropbox. This was slow, and prevented you from leaving the page, unless you no longer wanted your download. Now, just like all the integrations, uses TorBox&amp;#x27;s own high speed servers to upload directly to Dropbox&amp;#x27;s servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added 1Fichier integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to 1Fichier and get a link that takes you directly to the 1Fichier download page. With this you can also define a folder along with a login token in the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;quot;&amp;gt;TorBox settings&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, that allows you to put your files wherever you want in your 1Fichier account. You can also define a password when uploading to 1Fichier (This is only available via API at this time).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added GoFile integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to GoFile and get a link that takes you directly to the GoFile download page. You can also define your API key and a folder in the TorBox settings so you can put your files wherever you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/integrations&amp;quot;&amp;gt;integrations page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; shows off all of TorBox&amp;#x27;s amazing integrations in an easy to digest way, allowing you to view the pages, and authors, as well as a basic description of the integration and what you might use it for.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718567924927..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds section to landing page about integrations with a button taking you to the integrations page, we are pretty happy with how this turned out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568009521..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed a small edge case where the allow zip switch wouldn&amp;#x27;t be switched the same as the settings if opening and closing the Add Torrent popup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed some RSS feeds not working properly due to links not being accessible, due to redirects or others. The API will now follow redirects to be able to cater to more types of RSS feeds, rather than standard ones.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed previously missed RSS feed items from never downloading. The API will now check all of your previously, not downloaded, and not ignored RSS items for new torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Background tasks now run properly. These are invisible tasks that are crucial to the service staying afloat, and previously they were crashing, getting cancelled for some random reason, or other things that were preventing them from running.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Payments&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We finally made the move to Sellix subscriptions. All Stripe subscriptions were cancelled and users were advised to switch to our new subscription system, as to not lose service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Integrations&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Riven&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Plex-Debrid&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; rewrite has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use TorBox with Plex simply and easily using a simple app, either self-hosted, or hosted using an external service such as &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://store.elfhosted.com/product/riven&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ElfHosted&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We will be writing a guide on how to integrate and setup Riven with TorBox soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/Ferrite-iOS/Ferrite&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Ferrite&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a media search engine, which allows you to add searched items to a debrid, has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use a Stremio alternative, on iOS devices. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use Ferrite with TorBox soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://jdownloader.org/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;JDownloader2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, one of the most popular download managers has created a TorBox plugin, that allows you to use pretty much all of TorBox&amp;#x27;s features, right from the JDownloader application! You don&amp;#x27;t even need to use the TorBox website if you wanted to. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;THIS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you encounter bugs, please report it to us or the JDownloader team.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Using TorBox with the *arr apps is now possible! Thanks to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/westsurname/scripts/tree/main&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this application created by West&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, you can now use TorBox with your already existing arr apps! It is a little complicated to get set up, but we will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Like mentioned above, we now have 1Fichier and GoFile integrations, which work seamlessly with TorBox. We are also working on a Mega integration as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The TorBox stremio addon now gets searches from Torrentio and other existing search APIs, as well as it&amp;#x27;s own. This is due to the amount of complaints we get about quality as well as loading speed with our own search API. While we are very proud of our own APIs, it is very obvious that we haven&amp;#x27;t spent as much time perfecting the search as Torrentio or other search APIs have. We want to provide the best experience possible for our users, so even if that means not using our own home grown solutions, we will do it, so we have. Results should be nearly identical to Torrentio, but will all the added features of TorBox&amp;#x27;s Stremio addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed filtering and gave more results to addon due to bad parsing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Discord Bot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed handling torrents that don&amp;#x27;t have a name attached. Before, the application would crash trying to split up a torrent magnet. This is no longer an issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Slightly increased responsiveness and decreased response times (this is a good thing). Average response time dropped from 25 seconds (uncached) to about 12 seconds (uncached), and from 12 seconds (cached) to about 7 seconds (cached). We would call that a success! The change was that each file was being hashed (getting the MD5) every time the file was part of a request. This is exceptionally inefficient, luckily this has been fixed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BREAKING CHANGE: There is no longer any endpoints for adding to Google Drive, and Onedrive from the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/webdl&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/usenet&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; endpoints.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;BREAKING CHANGE: For the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/checkcached&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; endpoint, if there are no cached results found, the data key will only show null rather than an object. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/example/29572726-400c4b83-2e6c-407e-9614-237a12aa787d&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NEW:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;{\n   &amp;quot;success&amp;quot;: true,\n   &amp;quot;detail&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;No cached data found.&amp;quot;,\n   &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: null\n}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;OLD:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;{\n   &amp;quot;success&amp;quot;: true,\n   &amp;quot;detail&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;No cached data found.&amp;quot;,\n   &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: {\n      &amp;quot;data&amp;quot;: false\n   }\n}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are now able get the files inside of the cached torrent/web download/usenet download. This works on any of the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/checkcached&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;endpoints (as all do the exact same thing). This can be used for more rich data to show to your users.

Last time we did WebDAV, now we have gone ahead and done the speed test page to look all proper. An added feature of this change is seeing test files that are available to download to test real life speeds. A lot of users didn&amp;#x27;t exactly know this existed, so here it is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1717493116079..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Faster searching speeds. Speeds for uncached data should be about 33% faster.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better search results. There should be more results, and more resolutions available. Before, seeing 2160p content was rare. With the new search API, it is quite common (if even available).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Internally, we have switched from Jackett to Prowlarr, which has already shown to give better searching speeds and gives better results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;age&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; parameter is now available on torrents as well.

Before it was only /torrents, now it should be every endpoint.

Our future at Stripe is looking bleak and we decided to move sooner rather than later. We believe in the future of Sellix and their awesome developer team.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to create subscriptions using PayPal, Cashapp, Cryptos and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More privacy. Stripe allowed us to see a lot about the user purchasing, which we weren&amp;#x27;t exactly happy about. We hardly ever looked at customer data, but there are times when we must, and the amount we had on a user was sort of unsettling. Data such as Name, Region, IP, Card Details, and sometimes even address and zip were exposed to us by default with Stripe. Sellix keeps customer privacy first which are very happy about.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Localized payments and region specific pricing (coming soon). Sellix has more power over their systems than Stripe seems to have, and it allows you to view payments in your own language and currency and soon, region specific pricing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long term stability. Stripe has a rocky history of banning businesses and keeping funds. We would rather not let that happen to us.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upgrades and downgrades are now prorated! If you upgrade your subscription your days will be prorated to your new plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long term seeding is finally here! You can now seed your torrents for as long as you are subscribed to the plan! Your torrents will continually seed with unlimited ratio with no issue. This also is sort of like long term storage (read below). Seed all your private torrents or seed your favorite publics!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1717214858318..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Long term storage is also here! You can now store your files for infinite amount of time through TorBox! For only $6/mo, your files no longer expire after 30 days of inactivity! This allows you to hoard to your heart&amp;#x27;s content. Fair use storage is currently set to 3TB before it sends us a notification, and we have to look at your account. If you need more storage than that, we can work something out for you at around $2/tb.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1717214458338..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New status page! This allows us more control over monitoring our services in a UI that looks much better and gives users more information about issues going on at TorBox. This includes incident tracking and management, which we can use for a whole lot of things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1717213413938..png&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;710&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;532.5&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The WebDAV has a new, but still familiar look! This allows the WebDAV to match to the rest of the TorBox service design, something we are very proud of. This should also make your experience a little easier as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On top of that, you now get a download count, a file count, and a functional logout button!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1717213570473..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; data-tight=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The subscription page has been updated to look like all the other pricing sections. With the new Subscribe button, you don&amp;#x27;t even have to leave TorBox to complete your purchase.

This was a needed change and was the cause of the random SSL errors, random downtimes and other strange errors. Since changing, things have been working properly and much faster than before. We have concluded that after 6 months of using NPM &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;it is not production ready&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, especially at the volume we do (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;roughly 2 million requests per day)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. This change also allows us to more carefully tune our configurations for speed, and reliability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed some zip downloads not properly processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds support for V2 torrents.

Basically if your torrent magnet has &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;btmh&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; in it rather than (or in addition to) &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;btih&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, then it is now supported. Previously it would simply say &amp;quot;Torrent rejected by the server&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better reliability when getting the torrent hash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better reliability with debrid links.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brings back MD5 hashes to files. This was requested by users, as well as for the future of TorBox as we will now be checking for viruses (simple, non-intrusive, and non-removing, acts more as a &amp;quot;hey this torrent has a virus, watch out&amp;quot;, not a &amp;quot;this torrent has a virus and you are not allowed to download it&amp;quot; type of vibe), and the simplest way is by MD5 hash.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed web downloads &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(debrid downloads)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; not showing progress even though they were downloading just fine.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;KNOWN ISSUE: &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;We are aware of the issues with &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://storage.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;storage.torbox.app&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;. This is a result of not having enough servers to meet the download demands of all of our users during peak hours. We are quickly working on scaling to be able to handle the load. You may notice for a few minutes that the storage is completely inaccessible. We apologize for this inconvenience. We are striving to make TorBox as reliable as possible over the next updates.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-26T22:12:58Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.1.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v411</link>\n            <guid>664fdf11437842ba6f88300c</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to choose whether your large downloads are zipped prematurely or not. Some people preferred to download their files separately, so now there is a setting to change this behavior. By default, TorBox will zip the files prematurely (if there are over 100 files in the download).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This can be changed on a per-torrent basis or globally. To change per-torrent, click &amp;quot;Advanced Settings&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;Add Torrent&amp;quot; popup. To change globally, simply flip the switch in the settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dashboard will no longer update if you are idle for more than 30 seconds, or if you are out of the tab. This was changed due to bandwidth prices and data being wasted due to people sitting on the dashboard hours at a time simply idling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If coming back from idle, simply click anywhere on the screen, and you will start receiving updates again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you moved away from the tab, simply come back and click anywhere on the screen and you will start receiving updates again.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads will still update by themselves every 60 minutes automatically.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed some support links around the site.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed the somewhat constant &amp;quot;This torrent was rejected by the server&amp;quot; error. This was due to the torrent being added to the server, but the server not reporting it properly. This was solved by simply deleting the torrent if it was already existing, then adding it again. Sorta a brute force method, but it wastes hardly any data, and works, which our users will appreciate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to send &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;allow_zip&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;create_torrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; endpoint which tells TorBox not to zip the torrent at all when processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Does not automatically zip downloads created through Stremio. Previously, users who downloaded season packs or entire show packs would not be able to stream the torrent because it would be automatically zipped by TorBox prematurely as of v4.1. This is no longer the case for downloads created through the Stremio addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-24T04:44:40Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.1.0</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v410</link>\n            <guid>66466740f2e971f09695e42d</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have been cooking this update for awhile! Today we are proud to introduce web streaming of any video file, our high speed, private VPN service, as well as some much wanted Stremio addon updates and overall upgrades and updates to the service. Let&amp;#x27;s get into it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;You are now able to stream &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;any&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; video file through the browser&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. TorBox has started down the path of transcoding, and media playback, so here we are. In our awesome and beautiful web player, you can stream &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;any&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; video file you have on your TorBox account. This is usually much faster than standard playback of videos as we are transcoding the file, making playback more efficient. Also thanks to Cloudflare&amp;#x27;s caching it&amp;#x27;s even faster than normal downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This should be the preferred way to watch content. It works on every device, is fast and is getting more and more features as time goes on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Full playback is supported, mkv, mp4, you name it, you can play it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With audio selection, as well as subtitles and subtitle selection, you can be sure you aren&amp;#x27;t missing out on the streaming experience with TorBox&amp;#x27;s web player.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are keeping tally&amp;#x27;s, this official means our feature set is equal and greater than Real-Debrid&amp;#x27;s (and you haven&amp;#x27;t even gotten to the rest of this update yet). This means that now, not only is TorBox cheaper, but has more features than RD, which is pretty cool.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;New tools page&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This page has a lot of interesting and useful tools for your journey torrenting with TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first tool is a magnet link to torrent file converter. Simply put your magnet link into the text box and click the submit button. After a few seconds, your device will automatically start downloading the newly generated torrent file.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This requires the website to interact with TorBox&amp;#x27;s API to retrieve metadata about the torrent, which is why it can take a decent amount of time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The next tool is exactly the opposite, it takes a torrent file, and gives you a magnet link. Unlike the previous converter, this one is nearly instant, giving you a magnet link extremely quickly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final tool is a button that generates your VPN WireGuard configuration! This means that you can download the configuration on any device, and use TorBox&amp;#x27;s VPN on any device as well. You can view all the devices compatible with WireGuard &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.wireguard.com/install/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not only is this VPN free for paid users, it is super fast, doesn&amp;#x27;t store logs, and unlimited bandwidth. We use Cloudflare servers to route traffic, so your information is private, fast, and always connected near you. This also will increase your download speeds from TorBox as TorBox runs on the Cloudflare network as well. Using the TorBox VPN is like having a direct connection to TorBox&amp;#x27;s servers. Pretty neat huh?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have been having slow downloads, buffering, or anything similar to that, try out the VPN.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are only able to use this VPN on 4 devices total before devices start swapping spaces. If you add 4 devices, and try to add one more, the first device you added will be swapped with the newest 5th device.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have unlimited bandwidth (8TB per month, up to 10x more if requested) so go crazy with it!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Any torrents over 100 files large will now be zipped prematurely. This saves you and TorBox bandwidth, and decreases the risk of downloads failing when downloading a zip later on. This does come with a penalty in processing time, as the server needs time to prematurely zip all of those files. At least it is doing it in a safe environment, where nothing will break compared to a high bandwidth and fluctuating environment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All paid users have access to our TorBox VPN. Enjoy!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Mostly&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; fixed downtime issues. Still working on some storage problems, sorry, you likely won&amp;#x27;t notice as it only happens for a split second once or twice a day.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New streaming endpoints. Allows you to create streams, get stream info, and more. This is a more efficient way of streaming your video content through TorBox, saves bandwidth and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time of writing, there are no docs yet, we are working on documentation for everything, and this is on the lowest priority of the list.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent searches should produce more results. Previously we were not using as efficient Jackett API&amp;#x27;s, but now, it should be equal to the results searched from the TorBox dashboard. Yes, we run on about 8 Jackett instances to support all of these searches.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Instead of just viewing your downloaded content in the &amp;quot;Your Media&amp;quot; discovery page, you can now find your content in their respective titles! Say you download a file from anywhere named &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://Big.Bunny.4k.mp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Big.Bunny.4k.mp&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;4&amp;quot;, you can now search Stremio like normal and open the Cinemeta page, and find the file in there labeled &amp;quot;TorBox (Your Media) (Resolution)&amp;quot;. This feature is extremely similar to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/MrMonkey42/stremio-addon-debrid-search&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Debrid Search&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which was a heavily requested feature from our users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Matching isn&amp;#x27;t always perfect. Since it can only rely on file names, if the names are bad, or look nothing like the content, such as only being &amp;quot;S01E02&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;Show S01E02&amp;quot; then TorBox won&amp;#x27;t be able to categorize it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compatible with Usenet and Torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compatible with any catelog!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This now allows you to use subtitles on your own content using your favorite subtitle addons!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Search should be at least a little bit faster. On average we have gathered about 3 seconds time in total.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the data is already cached, meaning someone has already clicked on that title, time can be as low as 1 second.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When the data needs to be scraped, it can go all the way up to 30ish seconds to get initial data. If you aren&amp;#x27;t happy with the data it delivers, come back in about 5 minutes to get the data that was scraped in the background.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-21T04:48:39Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.9</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v409</link>\n            <guid>663c6c4db8297cfd343d5ffb</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes queued downloads not being added in order. Queued downloads will now be added from oldest to newest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Retries when adding new torrents from the dashboard. This will try to add your torrent up to 5 times before erroring out. Just in case.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Same with Usenet and Debrid/Web Downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes bug with seeding settings not being correct when adding a torrent. This was due to the state not being correct on first load. Always worked if you went to a different page and came back. Only affected new sessions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speeds up loading of settings page settings from cloud up to 200%. Meaning it is 2x faster. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The settings page buttons look a bit better on smaller screens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed text of Discord Link button. When you are already linked, you can click the button again to re-link, but users weren&amp;#x27;t aware, so we added a little bit of text to let you know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows unlinking your Discord account from TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-09T06:41:42Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.8</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v408</link>\n            <guid>66370ca24d0f39d2c348428d</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to purchase additional slots for your TorBox account. This means that instead of being limited to 3, 5 or 10 download/seeding slots you are able to purchase as many as you want. Most people won&amp;#x27;t ever need to purchase additional slots, but if you are a power user, you might want to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reduces price of yearly Standard plan to $55. Previously it was at $60, which is just the 12 month price. With this change you get a free month for purchasing yearly, which matches the rest of the subscriptions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds section in Addons tab for the concurrent downloads addon. Simply shows options for purchasing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All subscriptions are shown inside the &amp;quot;Manage Subscription&amp;quot; button from the dashboard, which allows you to manage all of your current and future TorBox subscriptions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you get a warning about being over the limit, TorBox will show the correct limit, instead of 10, for whatever reason.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-05T04:40:50Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.7</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v407</link>\n            <guid>66356eaf925a6354129e63ec</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds invisible retries when requesting downloads. This is due to the API being somewhat unreliable for some users. This gives the API 5 tries before failing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is most useful when batch requesting links as hitting the API with 300 requests at the same time can lead to failures on some files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds AirPlay, Google Cast, PiP, and Download buttons on the in-browser video player.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If a link fails to retrieve, it doesn&amp;#x27;t do any further action.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before, it would still open a new tab, or copy &amp;quot;null&amp;quot; to your clipboard. This has now been fixed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speeds up Stremio addon search speeds by over 50%. This is due to our cache having a low expiry, meaning that even if someone else searched less than an hour ago for the same streams, it would force you to research for them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uses Torznab searches for better accuracy rather than using the default Jackett API. Expect more results, better and faster results from the API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-03T23:14:11Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.6</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v406</link>\n            <guid>66317e62ebe828eff0541cdd</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes playing items on Kodi when using the flattened structure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Makes folders more readable by artificially diving down one folder to see the download name.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before the webDAV would show the hash of the download, which is how we store the files, but it made it hard to pick and choose items.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Should improve reliability on other webDAV clients as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds dialogue when there are no search results in the NZB search so it doesn&amp;#x27;t look broken.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes user media not showing any streams on TV clients.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-05-01T02:03:31Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.5</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v405</link>\n            <guid>662f0b509a6d83c7a7a8e9dd</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speeds up dashboard loading speeds by 3x and even 4x in some cases!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reduced calls to database.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reduced recursion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On Usenet downloads and Web downloads on small screens, the buttons when you click on a download is dropped down instead of squished together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sorts Usenet downloads and Web downloads and puts active ones at the top.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds surveys.

Same with Usenet but seeders as age. This means that it is possible that a low resolution, high seeder file will come above a low seeder, 1080p stream.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-04-25T21:17:48Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.3</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v403</link>\n            <guid>661b4152fcecf34decc21042</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Web downloads and Usenet downloads now update properly on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds more hosters to debrid/web downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds error for Free or Essential users adding private torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Private torrents are limited to Standard and Pro users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-04-14T02:42:14Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v402</link>\n            <guid>66185e41e123445ee3869708</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds searching for NZB&amp;#x27;s directly inside TorBox, just like the torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching is not instant or as you type.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You have to be pretty specific when you search.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Not the most accurate way of getting items, such as searching by episode, is hard to do right now.

Before there would 502 Gateway Timeouts and such. Now connections should be under 10 seconds max (depending on your location). US location was tested with about 5 seconds, Germany with 2 seconds, and Netherlands with around 1 second to connection.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made zipped files more efficient and works with large files. Before there would be a limit of about 100gb per file, now there is no limit!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed a race condition where Usenet downloads will be finished before the record is added to the database, meaning the completed download doesn&amp;#x27;t know it exists yet. Crazy situation, but it is now fixed meaning that any sized downloads work with our insane Usenet download speeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-04-11T04:39:34Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v4.0</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v40</link>\n            <guid>6615c20f026bad3f2b0a1cef</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is TorBox&amp;#x27;s largest update to date. Introducing v4.0, where the major features include, Usenet, Web Downloads (Debrid), a rewritten storage API, and a more stable and reliable service. Along with major features, our infrastructure has changed significantly, and we are pretty much at endgame setup, so things are just scaling up from here.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds a Add NZB button to the dashboard. This allows you to add an NZB link or file that will then download the files from the Usenet. The files received from usenet will then be available to download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will talk more about usenet downloads in the service section.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This button, although visible, will not be usable to non-Pro members. It will instead ask you to upgrade to Pro if you hover over it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds an Add Web Link to the dashboard. This allows you to add any link and it will be downloaded to your account. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is commonly used as a debrid for things such as 1Fichier, RapidGator, YouTube, Google Drive and more&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. The file will transfer to your account and will be available to download, just like a torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will talk more about web downloads in the service section.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This button, although visible will not be usable to free users. It will instead ask you to upgrade to a paid plan if you hover over it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Web Downloads are shown on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They are shown below the torrents for now. We need to combine them all into the same list, it is some internal frontend issue, we will add sorting and filtering as well soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are not able to pause web downloads from the dashboard. Once a download has been started, there is no stopping it, unless you delete it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet downloads are shown on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like web downloads, they are shown below torrents due to internal layouts of the dashboard. This will be addressed soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are able to pause and resume usenet downloads, although why would you want to?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet and Web Downloads have the same look and feel as the torrents. They also are just as reactive. Download speeds will count towards the graph on the dashboard as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Everything basically works the exact same as the torrents. Just click on the download button and you will be brought to the familiar download page to choose the files, and how you want to download the files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Dial on the left side, which shows the quota free users have left. This has been redone to show fancy colors depending on how many you have left.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed how the avatar/user section is laid out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no longer a server name, or server IP as internally, users aren&amp;#x27;t assigned to a server anymore. We will talk about that more in the service section.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The space has no been replaced with some cool stats.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now see how much data you have downloaded (in torrents, usenet downloads and web downloads, not from TorBox itself).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now see how much data you have uploaded (data your torrents have seeded).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The above data is now used to calculate an overall ratio. There is no risk for having a low ratio or anything, but it is just a cool stat to see. If your ratio is under 1, a sad face will show. If your ratio is over 1, but under 5, a cool face will show. If ratio over 5, there will be a golden crown to show how much of a king (or queen) you are. Basically this is for bragging rights.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We will eventually show more dialed in data, such as data for today, data for the week, or data for the month.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; this data started with the update. If you were or are a previous TorBox user, you are still starting fresh, we just don&amp;#x27;t have data from previous to this update.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated Pricing page to reflect changes in free plan and changes to the upper plans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On smaller screens, to avoid overflows, &amp;quot;Add Torrent&amp;quot; is simply &amp;quot;Torrent&amp;quot;. We might change how this looks on smaller screens in the future, as we aren&amp;#x27;t exactly happy with this change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added the new Usenet feature. This allows you to access the Usenet without paying for any extra subscritpions. We handle everything from searching (soon), providers, storage and integration into Stremio and the rest of TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Files are cached just like torrents, so if it is a popular usenet download, it will likely be cached. If it isn&amp;#x27;t it will download just like normal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently we use &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.eweka.nl/en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Eweka&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.newsdemon.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Newsdemon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as providers. We are going to add blocks soon, and if needed, more providers if users run into issues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use special &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;20gbit servers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to download these usenet files. They are downloaded to enterprise NVME drives and then extracted like normal to the drives. They are then cached to our mass storage servers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Usenet is only available to Pro users.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; If you want to use Usenet, make sure to upgrade to our Pro plan for only $10/mo! We don&amp;#x27;t offer this to free or paid plans as it costs quite a bit for us to offer Usenet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching is coming soon. We already search for the Stremio addon, we just need to make it available on the website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use multiple indexers, and have been collecting some for awhile. This will allow you to use the best quality, and least likely to fail files. We won&amp;#x27;t say which ones specifically we use, but just know they are elite and the best indexers you can get access to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;To address indexer bans: we don&amp;#x27;t have to worry about getting banned. Files are locked down, and inaccessible to the public (meaning you have to add the files through the site or Stremio to use them). We cache results, so the API&amp;#x27;s aren&amp;#x27;t being hit over and over again. Only Pro users are able to use this feature, even using our API, and since it is only a smaller subset of our users, the usage won&amp;#x27;t be as high as if we offered it to all paid users.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use a custom self-hosted instance of SABNzbd and we actively sponsor them as well through their PayPal. Thanks to the team for such an awesome and extendable usenet downloader.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Added the new Web Download (debrid) feature.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This allows you to download pretty much any file on the internet without the extra subscription. Just like with Usenet, we handle everything, giving you the most seamless experience possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Just like Usenet and Torrents, web downloads (debrid downloads, we refer to them as web downloads) are cached and are instantly available for anyone who downloads them afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; we don&amp;#x27;t have a hoster list or a site list yet, that will come soon.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usage is pretty much &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;unlimited&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, but of course, there it all falls under fair use, and will count as an active download until complete, so depending on your plan, you can only download so many at a time. This is the same for all types of downloads. We are adding addons soon that will improve these limits for a small price.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use the same &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;20gbit servers&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; to download the web downloads, so you can be sure that speeds will be quick to download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Web Downloads are only available to paid plans.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Any paid plan has access to web downloads. We don&amp;#x27;t offer this to free users due to abuse.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use a custom/modified self-hosted &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://pyload.net/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Pyload&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; instance and its API to download your web downloads. Thanks to the team for an awesome service. We have donated to the team through their PayPal as thanks for an awesome service.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All web downloads are downloaded through a residential proxy meaning that any file is downloadable, and the server won&amp;#x27;t get banned from websites or file hosters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Free user&amp;#x27;s limitations have been increased&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. This was done to increase conversion, as the free plan was not meant to be a real plan, rather a trial. We understand that this might be upsetting. In the future, when TorBox becomes financially stable, we can think about bringing these limits back up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Max size per torrent has been reduced to 50gb&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, down from 100gb per torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Torrent transfer speed has been reduced to 250mbps&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (31.25MB/s on the dashboard), down from 1gbps (125MB/s on the dashboard).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;6 hour seeding has been reduced to 6 hours&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, down from 24 hours.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;In return, all paid plans have been boosted.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Essential and Standard now gets&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Unlimited web downloads&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (access to web downloads).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;ncrease to 200gb max torrent size per torrent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, from 100gb max torrent size. Many users were complaining it was too small, so we have listened and increased the max size.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro gets&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Unlimited web downloads&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (access to debrid).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Unlimited usenet downloads&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; (access to usenet).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We now have switched from our previous server provider, which was Leaseweb. They were mostly good to work with, but the amount we were spending on bandwidth was just way too much, so we have switched. We are very happy with our new providers and are very happy with their services. You can view more about our infrastructure at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://hetrix.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://hetrix.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Storage&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The storage API has been rewritten in Rust!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Previously it had been written in Python, but this was not fast enough and we noticed a difference of over 50% speed difference with Python (afterwards) in a production highly concurrent environment. Obviously this is not good, so we went ahead and rewrote the entire thing in Rust. In a server to server environment (different data centers, both 10gbit), we noticed speeds hitting over &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;3gbps&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; over Rust (&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://actix.rs/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Actix&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), whereas using Python (&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;FastAPI&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), we were maxing out around 1gbps. Of course this is in a perfect environment. Even so, in real-world tests we regularly hit 1.5gbps or higher (concurrently, other users were downloading at the same time).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apart from the transfer speeds, this also increased zipped download speeds, which is intensely I/O heavy, we have noticed an increase in over 35% speeds, thanks to Rust being highly focused on concurrent threads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; while downloads are fast, that&amp;#x27;s only if you can access them. In a few cases, so far around 20% of downloads fail due to the file not existing. This is due to file information not being propagated to all servers in fast enough time, meaning you might access the file over a server that doesn&amp;#x27;t know the file exists yet. This usually only happens to brand new transfers that just got marked as &amp;quot;Download Ready&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cached&amp;quot;. We are working on a solution to this complex issue.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Stremio addon now has the ability to watch Usenet content if you are on the Pro plan. These will show up as streams, labeled with the type &amp;quot;Usenet&amp;quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents now show a type of &amp;quot;Torrents. Usenet downloads now show a type of &amp;quot;Usenet&amp;quot; so you can distinguish them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are a free user using the addon. There will be a small advertisement at the top of the streams asking you to subscribe. It&amp;#x27;s small and sort of out of the way, and even offers a discount!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Usenet media files are shown in the &amp;quot;Your Media&amp;quot; section in the Discover tab.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; while movies and short seasons, and popular content has many different options for streams, some edge cases or very large series will not have many streams. We are working on a solution for that. It will be fixed soon.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;WebDAV&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes minor bugs with WebDAV not being able to show all of your files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows web downloads and Usenet downloads in WebDAV allowing you to access them just like torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The search API now has the&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/usenet&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;) endpoint which allows you to search for NZB&amp;#x27;s on the usenet using our indexers.

No NZB files are accessible. You can see the link, but they are null-routed outside of our network, thanks to Tailscale.

Any old links will not work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added endpoints for Usenet. These endpoints mostly mirror how the torrent endpoints work. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/folder/29572726-0ee58f08-0056-4cab-af51-38d758769aeb?ctx=documentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt;You can read more about those here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added endpoints for Web Downloads.

This data is updated once every hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Please note:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; RSS Feeds refreshing has been disabled for now. They will not automatically update. There are a few things wrong with them internally, as they have not been developed as not many users use them, so they have fallen behind in updates. We will spend some time making sure they are awesome again in the following updates.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That pretty much wraps up v4.0. There are quite a few bugs for us to fix, so I guess we will get started on that! Enjoy the new update and let us know if you have any issues!

Combined with this, we recently hit 30,000 downloads (this means the number of torrents added)! We also are adding a pretty large feature, which is not exactly a breaking change, but changes how TorBox seeds torrents from now on. This also introduces a lot of cool UI changes and features, so read more below!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/pricing&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Adds new pricing page!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; This allows you to fully view the pricing and makes for easier comparison between plans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed wording in footer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed wording of some CTA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes color of Manage Subscription button on Dashboard to have more contrast.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes MFA code entry form to look a lot nicer and more familiar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/about&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Changes about page graphic to be a little more fancy.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New setting for changing caching settings for torrents added. This allows you to choose 1 of 3 new seeding presets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Auto.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This is the default. Keeping on auto, means that TorBox will decide what torrents will be seeded. TorBox will take into consideration factors such as if the torrent is private, torrent health, seeders, peers and more to make an informed decision whether to seed the torrent or not. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;NOTE: TorBox will seed more often than not in auto mode.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Always.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This is the option you choose if you want all of your torrents to seed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Never.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; This is the option you choose if you want all of your torrents to not seed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New setting for changing caching settings for torrents added through the Stremio addon. This is exactly like the above setting, except that it is specifically for Stremio torrents. This allows you to have even more flexibility when adding torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Advanced section in the New Torrent popup/dialog that will have additional settings when adding torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New drop down in this section that is exactly like the above settings, except for overriding your settings for specifically this torrent. If for example, you usually add private torrents, and this is a public torrent, you can make this specific torrent to not seed, but keep your default setting at always seed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed button asking you to enable notifications on mobile. Most mobile devices don&amp;#x27;t support push notifications from the browser anyways, so the button was simply removed. If you want notifications on your device, download the mobile app!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now sends a notification on sign in. It tells you the IP and device that was signed into. This way you can keep your account secure if you notice that this wasn&amp;#x27;t you signing in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allowing users to not seed instantly opens up a active torrent slot, and makes the torrent cached rather than seeding and taking up an active slot.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds ability to specify an option on the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/createtorrent&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; path for seeding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When sending a multipart form, if you want to specify a seeding setting, send use the key name, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;seed&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. Accepted values are numbers from 1-3. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;1 meaning auto, 2 meaning seed, 3 meaning don&amp;#x27;t seed.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Search API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/search/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;query&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; route which allows you to search by any type of query and return metadata for the results.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uses Meilisearch in the background so it is super fast, accurate, and you are able to search for literally anything, titles, aliases in other languages, actors, characters, and more.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds tutorial endpoints such as for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/meta&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/torrents&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/search&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, which tells you all about the endpoints.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Usenet coming next!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-03-16T20:29:17Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.6.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v364</link>\n            <guid>65f33e38fbbd7939890d0659</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds a context menu for torrents. Allows you to right-click (or hold on mobile) a torrent to bring up additional options, as well as the standard options for the torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The standard options are the same as simply clicking on the torrent normally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The new options are under the &amp;quot;More Tools&amp;quot; section. Simply hover over this button to show the new options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There are 4 new options (2 for cached downloads).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Copy ID&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This simply copies the ID of the torrent for use elsewhere. Maybe for sharing with support, or using with the API for one-off requests. This is available for cached downloads as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Copy hash&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Very similar to copying the ID, and used for likely the same things. This is available for cached downloads as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Copy magnet&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Simply copies the magnet link for the torrent. Allows you to get the magnet even for torrents created using torrent files. Sends a network request to get the information from the API so it may not be copied instantly. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is not compatible with cached torrents and are not shown.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Export .torrent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Downloads the torrent file for the torrent. Allows you to get the torrent file even for torrents created using magnet links. Sends a network request to get the information from the API so it may not be copied instantly. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This is not compatible with cached torrents and are not shown.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds a new option for downloading. Instead of downloading using zips, you can now download links separately but in batches.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To use, click on the clipboard, next to the folder icon. These icons are located at the very top of folders. (If you don&amp;#x27;t know what button does what, simply hovering over it will give you some info).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1710443142286..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It will begin to load while it retrieves the links for you. Depending on how many files are inside the folder, it could take awhile. Once it is complete it will open up the popup that shows you all of the files that were inside the folder you selected as well as some options.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Click the check boxes to choose which files are selected or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can click on the names of the files to instantly start downloading that file, or copy the link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These options do the following:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Copy All&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, copies all the download links regardless of what are selected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Copy Selected&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, only copies the links that are selected.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Download All&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, downloads all the links regardless of what are selected. (Make sure to have popups enabled or else only one link will open).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Download Selected&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, downloads only the links that are selected. (Make sure to have popups enabled or else only one link will open).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1710443255203..png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds new endpoint for exporting torrent magnets and torrent files. This is useful for users who want to share a torrent, or simply want to keep the torrent file. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/exportdata&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29572726/2s9YXo1zX4#3847e19a-0de7-4956-a072-4c4d41d0ff6c&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is not supported for cached torrents.

This is due to abuse from users pausing torrents and them being able to stay on the servers for longer. We previously didn&amp;#x27;t have any way to combat this, so users were able to keep a torrent paused, but on the download server taking up precious NVME and HDD space. This change was also made on the API side.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improved SEO as the site has been getting hit by Google a lot recently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New setting for Stremio Addon allows you to filter Adult content. This filters it from coming up in streams, or in search. This means, for example, if your kid clicks on some Adult content from another catalogue, streams won&amp;#x27;t show up. Same for search, if a search is supposed to return Adult results, it won&amp;#x27;t.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Default setting does not show adult content. No config needed.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; The only reason to change this setting is to show it. You dirty dog. (Not that TorBox has a lot of adult media anyways, but there is some).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New setting for webDAV. You can now flatten your folders, and only show the downloads inside. So if you previously were having to dive into your folders just to find a certain media, then no more!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also now makes TorBox work with most webDAV clients such as Infuse. Apple TV users rejoice! (I recently purchased one and I love it, which is why this feature is here. On the topic of Infuse, Firecore, the parent company has the worst support and forum ever. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://community.firecore.com/t/change-webdav-depth-from-1-to-infinity/48039/4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Take a look at this discussion on the technical issue of why TorBox wasn&amp;#x27;t working previously with Infuse.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; Their team has no idea about anything technical it seems. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Anyways...&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Switched to a new scraping mechanism for torrents! We are now on a event based scraping system (which is what everyone else is doing for some reasons I will explain in a second). This means that as long as it is on a popular tracker, then it will show up. No more waiting for the scraper to find the movie or show you want. Along with this change the metadata engine got an update, giving more rich experiences when using the TorBox Stremio Addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To support this new scraping mechanism, the entire system has been redesigned from the ground up. Focusing on accuracy, speed, and reliability, there isn&amp;#x27;t one addon with more features than TorBox&amp;#x27;s.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is a new search API that is open and free to use. You can check it out at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://search-api.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://search-api.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. It will be getting more updates in the future.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To use it use the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/meta/source:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; endpoint. To find Fight Club metadata, you would do &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/meta/imdb:tt0137523&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To find torrents, simply do the same thing with the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/torrents/source:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; endpoint. You can request metadata here by adding &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;?metadata=true&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; to the request.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All endpoints are cached so if it has already been searched for, it will return a response in less than 100ms!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I plan to write about the journey for this and all of my recent discoveries creating TorBox &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://wamy.substack.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here on Substack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you would like to tag along and possibly learn something.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before, we were using a single Jackett instance for scraping. Now we are using about 10 instances of load balanced Jackett to be able to handle the sheer amount of requests we are getting through the Stremio Addon. Pair that with a rotating proxy, and we have been able to achieve around 5s searching for around 10-15 indexers per request.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching is just as fast as ever thanks to Meilisearch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Metadata is extremely rich thanks to the combination of the IMDB and TMDB APIs for Movies and TV shows as well as the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://jikan.moe/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Jikan API&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for Anime.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Makes compatibility more accessible for other catalogs. For movies and TV shows, it isn&amp;#x27;t that wide of a range, you can search by IMDB and TMDB ID&amp;#x27;s. If you want to make your catalog compatible, make sure you add your source ahead of the ID, like &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;imdb:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, or &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;imdb_id:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, or another variation, and TorBox will be able to find it. For anime, it is similar but you can use even more sources such as &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mal_id:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;mal:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;anilist:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;kitsu:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;kitsu-id:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;kitsu_id:id&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and all other anime database sources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enhanced reliability. Recently, some of our core servers have been going down, and due to the reliance the API has on those servers, it would crash the API making it inaccessible for some time, making it inaccessible to users who need to use the API for other purposes. Now, a downed server will not affect the API, and if you try to use a downed server it will let you know there are connection issues to core servers, and they will be back online soon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To fight the issue of core servers going down, we are switching providers to one that won&amp;#x27;t let this happen anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-03-13T06:09:47Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.6.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v362</link>\n            <guid>65ea4cdd61760fa73a9c25aa</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads with multiple folders now only show the zip button at the root folder, eliminating confusion about which one to click, as they download the entire zip in the first place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed a bunch of bugs. No more weird error pages. If there is an error, it will now be reported as such and will give you a better error page and tell you what went wrong.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes about stats showing 0.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zip files now show a total size, and progress bar. This allows you to see how long a zip has left to download. A big Q.O.L. feature that has been missing for awhile is now back.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zips files should be more reliable for larger files, as well as get a speed increase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed webDAV showing 404 on root directory. Now only shows 404 if the file is missing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes download links not being able to be resumed. (Zip download links are not able to be resumed, but normal file downloads are).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;More email domains have been added to the blocklist. If you have an account with those email domains already, you won&amp;#x27;t be banned, but any new accounts will be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-03-08T00:06:37Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.6.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v361</link>\n            <guid>65e7f1ba61760fa73ad6c73b</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I know, I know, we just had an update and there are still a lot of bugs! Well, me and a few buddies did a little dev jam and I came up with working on my Discord bot (for TorBox). It took me about 12 hours to get it to this point, and I am pretty happy with it. I will resume with fixing more bugs (yes, I did fix some) now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Discord Bot&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox now has a Discord bot! This is a public bot that can be used anywhere. It&amp;#x27;s a little limited in functionality, but the main reason for having it around are Discord notifications. But, you can also add torrents on the go as well. This is basically a substitute for the mobile app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The main reason for using TorBox are the notifications. If you are like me, I always have Discord open, or I get notifications on my phone when I am away from my computer. This helps a lot, especially when most of the alerts for TorBox are done through Discord webhooks.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As long as your account is linked, and you share a server with the TorBox bot, you can get notifications by DM. It will send you a notification instantly, no waiting around for notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to opt out of these notifications, you can disable the setting on the TorBox settings page, by clicking the switch on the Discord Notifications option. You can also just block the bot for awhile if you are lazy like me.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also view your torrents, which is cool to share the status of your torrents to others. Show off that ratio baby!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Use the /list command for this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the torrent is ready to download, you can also download the torrent, simply by clicking on the name of the torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can also add new torrents! I am not sure if this has ever been done before, but you can upload files and magnet links (even torrent file links) to the bot, and it will add it to your account!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Use the /add command for this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Accepts either a magnet link, or torrent file. You cannot do both at the same time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Works as intended!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes streams not showing up. I know right? How could I let that happen. IDK!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speeds up scraper capabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loosened restrictions on matching media names, meaning that more torrents will show up. The value is still matched at 85% so if a name 85% matches the torrent name then it will pass. Before, it was at 95%.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-03-06T04:51:58Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.6</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v36</link>\n            <guid>65e423e20ac461d7dab51551</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The long awaited Stremio addon is available! Along with other changes, v3.6 is focused on the Stremio addon that is officially offered by TorBox.

This section is where you can configure how your integrations work with TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds multiple Stremio settings, that allow you to configure how you can interact with the addon.

This allows you to specify what languages you want to show up in the addon. The recommendation is to keep Unknown on as most torrents won&amp;#x27;t have a language.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cache Settings&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.

If you only want cached streams to show, then click on that setting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Only show torrents larger than size (in GB)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This setting does exactly that, only shows streams larger than a certain size. If you are looking for a specific quality size ratio, you can make this value something like 30.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Only show torrents smaller than size (in GB)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Same as the previous setting except that this is the upper limit that a torrent can be. If you only want small torrents, then you keep this value low.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added the Google Drive integration settings section.

This decreased request times by almost 10x. As it was being hosted on a mega server shared with all my other projects, the amount of network requests both API&amp;#x27;s were getting, they were being blocked by other requests the server was handling. Any issues regarding time outs, or requests not going through, or 502 errors have disappeared. This also fixes the uptime errors we have been running through.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes webDAV long downloads being cancelled halfway through.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes webDAV indexing speeds (going in and out of folders was very slow).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes webDAV 404 error when there is an inactive torrent on the account.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speeds up cache check requests by almost 2x.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stremio Addon:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces the Stremio addon! This is available at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://stremio.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://stremio.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. There are a lot of awesome features to go through, so this list is pretty long.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Configuration is done on the TorBox settings page. This allows for easy configuration that is done all in one place. These settings are also cloud saved meaning that they are instantly applied, with no need to reinstall the addon (ever!).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To add it to Stremio, go the the TorBox settings page and click the Access Stremio Addon.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The torrents are what provide TorBox with the files it needs to download to provide you with streams. TorBox scrapes torrents from lots of different trackers (semi-private and public) for the best torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How the torrents are scraped is a little complex, but basically it is just Jackett. Saying that, there is so much more that goes into it. I am planning on writing a blog post about it, along with other discoveries I have made over the years. There are a total of 3 different scrapers. One for Movies, one for Series (TV Shows), and one for Anime (cause I personally wanted a specific one for the best results). The movie and series scraper takes in a list of every single TMDB ID, gets the base metadata, external ID&amp;#x27;s, alternate titles, and more. It then searches Jackett for each one of the titles, and if it is a TV show, each title with each episode/season number. Once Jackett returns with the data, it cleans the data putting it into the specific order TorBox needs, and then adds it to Meilisearch (the database, which is meant for ultra-fast searches). The same process is done for Anime searches as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents include a quality, resolution, size, cache status, and more which allows you to filter properly. If a torrent doesn&amp;#x27;t have something, it is simply Unknown or 0.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scraper is run weekly to get the latest torrents. This also assures that new episodes, movies or specials show up in TorBox rather quickly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Search&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Searching for media is done at the top of Stremio, which allows you to quickly and easily search TorBox&amp;#x27;s scraped torrents. Not every item will have streams depending on the rarity of the media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Search is full-text meaning you can search for episodes, torrent names, alternate titles and more, and your results will likely show up. Typos included!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Integration with 3rd party catalogues is also very good. You are able to search by the following ID&amp;#x27;s and your results will show up:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IMDB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TMDB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TVDB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Livechart&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anime Planet&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anisearch&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AniDB&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kitsu&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;MyAnimeList&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anilist&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Streaming&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Streaming is supported anywhere Stremio is supported. If trying to use Stremio on the web, you are able to open the m3u8 file in an external player, such as VLC and it will play normally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Low/No buffering! With the power of TorBox&amp;#x27;s infrastructure, and advanced Cloudflare routing, buffering is no more! (As long as your internet speed is high enough).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloading&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If a torrent is not cached (does not say Instant) then clicking on the play button will start downloading the torrent to your TorBox account. A video will play stating that the torrent is downloading and you should wait for the download to finish.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If something goes wrong the video will state a generic error.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;#x27;t have enough slots on your account it will tell you that in the video.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the video is done downloading, you will have to play again, then it will begin streaming.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;TorBox Media&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can easily view your TorBox media that you have in your account by going to the Discover tab. Select Movies then select Your Media, and your TorBox media will show.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Each item has it&amp;#x27;s own custom poster so you know exactly what it is and where it came from at a glance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Future plans&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Intros to videos. Sort of like Netflix does, all media streamed through TorBox will play a 3 second intro video. It will add to the professionalism and cool factor of TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Audio filters. If you audio system cannot play certain audio codecs, this filter is a good idea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-03-04T00:40:37Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.5.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v352</link>\n            <guid>65d57f5329b251ac8322248f</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Revamped the subscription page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a section for information about payment methods. This includes information about payment methods, security, and some nice icons showing payment methods at a glance. This is different for each tab.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a new a Addons tab. This tab will soon include pricing for the new addon features that users have requested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Switched from PayPal and Coinbase to Sellix, which is a payment processor that combines PayPal, Crypto, and Card payments all in one, which makes it really easy for users to pay as well as expand TorBox in the future. Basically, nothing has changed, except for adding more crypto payment methods, as well as adding Skrill, and Perfect Money (in the future once TorBox gets approved).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes the open stream button being weirdly short on the download page.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes the look of the tabs on the New Torrent Modal, matching the style of the subscription page as well as just looking a lot more sleek.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-02-21T04:52:20Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.5.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v351</link>\n            <guid>65d1806bdf0b1cfd77091897</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added 2FA. Allows you to secure your account by making sure that no one can log in but you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only allows using TOTP MFA but more options will be coming eventually. This was a feature that I wanted to get out as soon as possible due to how much access you have to an account on the website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only affects logins for the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://TorBox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;TorBox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; website. You are no required to use 2FA when using the API, WebDAV, FTP, the mobile app, etc.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can use any 2FA solution, but we recommend Bitwarden. It can be self-hosted too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No backup codes. This isn&amp;#x27;t supported by Supabase, but you can contact us to get access back to your account if you somehow lose access to your 2FA.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added delete confirmations. This makes sure you might not be accidentally deleting things you don&amp;#x27;t want to delete.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a popup that asks you to confirm before deleting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This happens for every download, but you can choose to ignore this warning for the entire time you are logged in by hitting the switch in the popup.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Google Drive not working on iOS devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Slightly improved download speeds in some situations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed some downloads not being able to be downloaded if the name has special characters that aren&amp;#x27;t found in the UTF-8 encoding. It will make sure all download fit in the Latin-1 encoding, meaning it will also work in all browsers. This may mean you will see question marks (?) in place of special characters that cannot be encoded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-02-18T03:58:32Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.5</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v35</link>\n            <guid>65c81bff952f9d888f91f0b1</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The infrastructure update! Oh boy, this one is a doozy, and really should never really should have happened, but in short, we ended up moving to our own infrastructure on our own servers, with our own API&amp;#x27;s and all new methods for downloads. There were a lot of reasons why we did this, lets start with those first:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pricing.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; To keep TorBox affordable and low price as it is, we have to make sure that we are not spending over our margins, and with our previous solution, &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, that was not possible. Don&amp;#x27;t get me wrong, GoFile is extremely cheap at $3/tb, and $2/tb in egress, but unfortunately, not cheap enough for TorBox to be able to sustain itself. With the new infrastructure, we can get infinite egress at no charge, and less than $3/tb, which is already a big deal. TorBox users download over 8tb+ a day from our servers, so we have to make sure that we can handle all of that moving data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Control.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Control over your own storage and the flexibility it gives you is very powerful. We decided to move away because we were tied down to their limited API, as well as no control over how files are served in the slightest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Processing times, and unreliability.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; To be able to get the files available for download, they had to be transferred to GoFile&amp;#x27;s servers. This at times could take quite a long time or even straight up fail. This was completely unacceptable, and we dealt with it for awhile, but GoFile never really completely fixed the issue. They did help us out and made some crucial fixes that made it more manageable, but still never got completely fixed. This was one of our user&amp;#x27;s largest gripes while using GoFile.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Zipped downloads.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; GoFile promised us a zipped downloads feature, but never actually delivered on that promise. They had it available, in beta, and to only premium users on their site. As zipped downloads are extremely important on the TorBox platform, this left many users and large torrents practically inaccessible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Integrations.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; With the GoFile downloads, we could never be able to create the integrations we wanted, such as WebDAV, as it would make it nearly impossible due to their lackluster API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When GoFile was determined to not be usable anymore, we decided to prop up our own infrastructure and start from scratch. This was not an easy or simple journey, and took all the way up to today, this post to get right. Let me take you through what we tried, and the solution we eventually landed on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We started by trying out &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs&amp;quot;&amp;gt;SeaweedFS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This was what we were looking for. A distributed file system, accessible over any machine in the cluster, and had an S3 gateway that allowed us to easily integrate with little effort. This started out great, we got our servers all set up, and got everything going, and at the beginning, things were okay, but didn&amp;#x27;t really solve all of our problems, and also introduced more. It was definitely cheaper, we had more control, and allowed us to do zipped downloads and integrations, but processing times still were atrocious and unreliable. It also introduced a speed bottleneck. Each server can only handle 1gbit, but the way SeaweedFS is set up, you can&amp;#x27;t decide where downloads are routed through, so all downloads actually got sent through one heavily speed limited server which was a huge issue and lead to downloads being slow, like 200kbps slow. You can view the issue we made &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/issues/5266&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about our issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we tried out Ceph. Everyone who has dealt with distributed storage knows Ceph. It is a pain to setup and was the main reason we didn&amp;#x27;t use it. At this point we knew exactly what we wanted. We wanted Hot+Cold storage, instant transfer from torrents stored on the local system to the storage system, and an easy setup. Ceph only solved one of those issues. So we moved on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we tried out GarageFS. Again, didn&amp;#x27;t solve our issues. There was no way to transfer data from the local system to the storage system, without going through the network. They also have no way to do Hot+Cold storage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then we tried out Minio. Again, didn&amp;#x27;t solve the local storage issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, we tried out Rclone. This solved the issue of local storage issue, as we could use raw files as the storage system thanks to Alias. We were able to make a unified filesystem using all the servers using Union, and serving that over S3, we could route downloads properly. We were also able to implement hot and cold servers based off of remotes and only transferring new torrents to hot servers, all in the background, which also eliminated processing times, and made things really easy to setup over the command line, using a &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://gist.github.com/Wamy-Dev/4f10e107d812f13813a20fc7de2ce24a&amp;quot;&amp;gt;single bash script&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We ran into a few issues though:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The S3 gateway was impossible to secure down, meaning that for a period of time you could clone the entire TorBox cache and it was publicly available. This was a huge problem. You can read more about &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7616&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the issue here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Given the issues we had with hosting S3 over Rclone, we decided to try out something called S3Proxy. The problem here was that presigned requests simply didn&amp;#x27;t work which is how we gave out download links. There were also issues with authorization not working either, exposing the entire TorBox Cache. You can read more about &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy/issues/581&amp;quot;&amp;gt;that issue here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads were unstable. They would crash half way through, couldn&amp;#x27;t be resumed, and you could not use Multi-connection downloads like you could before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So we ended up writing another API specifically for the storage, which basically allows us to solve all of the issues we were facing. The TorBox cache is now completely private, download links are clean and simple to use. Errors are intuitive and have a nice page for users to look at. Downloads can be resumed, you can use up to 16 connections, zips are very easy to use, and no buffering slowdowns either. We did deal with some issues regarding speeds, but for now, they are adequate. We have been making optimizations (thanks to our control over the entire system) and speeds have been climbing. Right now you can expect to hit around 60-70MB/s, but we are trying to get closer to the theoretical maximum which is about 110MB/s. There are so many optimizations we are trying and testing, so I am confident we can get there. Anyways, that is the story of why there have been no updates in forever. We have been dealing with storage, to give our users the best experience possible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Now onto the actual change log:&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated main page speedtest to download the test files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Available is a 100MB file, 1GB file, and 10GB file. These are in bin format, but are just 0&amp;#x27;s. The .bin is there so the file can actually be downloaded by our backend.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Updated main page to remove anything about &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds a pricing button to the header. Eventually we will have a dedicated pricing page for this to lead to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds our infrastructure status link to the footer. This leads to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://hetrix.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hetrix.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which is our status page for all of our servers so you can see what each server is doing in real-time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds an announcement panel where general, warnings, errors, and service breaking issues are shown. We added this due to the recent small issues we have been getting on our site, and users contacting us about it, even though we announced it in the Discord server. This solution allows all users, just not members of the Discord to see issues about TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The different colors give indication how severe the issue is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Green Border means it is simply an announcement. Things such as discounts, promotions and general announcements will have this border. Easily ignorable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yellow Border means it is a warning error. If something is acting flaky, or we are investigating a possible issue, or the issue isn&amp;#x27;t too big of a deal, it will have this border.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Red Border means there is an error with the site, maybe downloads are down, or a specific part of the site is broken, but won&amp;#x27;t effect the whole experience, but only some parts of TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Red Background or a fully red box means that there is a service breaking error, TorBox is down for some reason, or something else that is a very important announcement.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Switched storage to in house.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unfortunately this meant that all previous torrents were wiped completely and all user&amp;#x27;s started fresh. There was a vote in our Discord server over to transfer or wipe the storage, and at a vote of 17-2, it was decided to wipe the storage completely and start from scratch.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also meant that for about a week, downloads were unreliable, failing, slow, or zips were broken.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the most part, these issues have been resolved, which is why we are comfortable releasing this as a version.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads are still not as fast as we would like, maxing out in most cases around 30-70MB/s. This is quite far from our goal of 110MB/s as described above. We are constantly making improvements to reach that goal.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download URLs and zip URLs look a little different now. Downloads are done at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://storage.torbox.app/dld/&amp;lt;presigned_key&amp;gt;?token=&amp;lt;api_token&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;storage.torbox.app/dld/&amp;amp;lt;presigned_key&amp;amp;gt;?token=&amp;amp;lt;api_token&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and zips are done at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://storage.torbox.app/zip/&amp;lt;presigned_key&amp;gt;?token=&amp;lt;api_token&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;storage.torbox.app/zip/&amp;amp;lt;presigned_key&amp;amp;gt;?token=&amp;amp;lt;api_token&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Remember to not share your download URLs publicly! They have your API key in them, which is required to download, as well is matched to the presigned token, so only the user which has the presigned token attached to their account can download the torrent. If you share this token, people can access your account, your torrents, and more! Don&amp;#x27;t let that happen!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download URLs are still only valid for one hour. This means that you have 1 hour to start the download until it expires. No, it won&amp;#x27;t cut your download short after that 1 hour, as long as you started it before that 1 hour. If you are downloading the file, then you don&amp;#x27;t have to worry about it. If you want to pause and come back, make sure you do it within that hour, or else that progress will be gone forever and you will have to restart the download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads are now multi-connection and resumable. This allows you to download super-fast using up to 16 connections to the server!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This 16 limit is per IP, not per download. If you have 2 downloads using up 8 connections each, you are at your limit. If you try to force 4 downloads using 6 connections each, the last download will never start, and the 3rd one will be limited to 4 connections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This limit also counts for single downloads. If you try to have more than 16 downloads at a time, the server will block any downloads afterwards until you have under or are at 16 connections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zips count for only 1 connections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resuming is now possible. Maybe you have a spotty connection, and the download gets paused, you can resume within an hour to continue the download from the progress it was at before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zips are not multi-connection. Zips are also not resumable, don&amp;#x27;t try to pause them, it will fail. These are due to technical reasons, as we zips torrents on the fly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you get an error on the download page, it will give you a nice readable error and the error page you know so well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Google Drive and OneDrive download errors. These&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; should&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; work fine now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We know this might not have been the update you were expecting, we were planning on other things too, but our operating expenses were getting too high, and we needed a new solution ASAP. We are resuming adding awesome new features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: We are aware of the issue with mismatching file sizes. We are investigating the issue. Keep up to date by &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://discord.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;joining our Discord server&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;. For now, the issue can be solved by simply waiting for the file to figure itself out. Depending on the size, this could take awhile, which is an issue. We are investigating. Thank you for your patience.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-02-13T22:23:34Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.4.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/new-changelog-358</link>\n            <guid>65af369c8a898e7dd25e8332</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed tons of bugs from launch of v3.4.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed large zip files from being processed. This was due to our MD5 hashing running out of memory for large files as we were not doing it in chunks as we were supposed to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed zip files from being located at &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/downloads/&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://zipfile.zip&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;zipfile.zip&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; rather than &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;/hash/&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://zipfile.zip&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;zipfile.zip&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which lead to some zip files with the same names being overwritten.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disallows trying to watch .mkv files in the browser, because it simply will just not work.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the settings tab, adds a section for Clients, where the mobile app buttons have been moved. This also has a link for Webdav as well as upcoming clients such as FTP, Stremio, Discord bot integrations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds loading indicator for requesting zip links.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Service&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moved zipping to separate API as it was causing problems being in the same container as the main API. Then new endpoint is &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://storage-zip.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://storage-zip.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Old requests to the normal API will be forwarded properly to the storage-zip API.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Added Webdav&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;! You can access it at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://webdav.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://webdav.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This works for both any webdav client or even your browser.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The website is absolutely beautiful and works very well. Would recommend this if on a desktop. 100% guaranteed it is the best webdav interface you have ever seen. Makes you feel more at home with TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Easily log in using your email and password, the same one you use for TorBox!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Requires you to have a password set up on your account. If you don&amp;#x27;t have one yet, go to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to send a password recovery email.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads are a little slow, just like all other downloads on the site right now. This is a work in progress and we are getting more servers soon which will speed things up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Access this on all different platforms such as Kodi, Infuse and more!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This does not work for older GoFile files, so it will not show those torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Due to the way we internally organize torrents, the hash of the torrent has to be shown on the root path. We are looking to eventually only show the name of the torrent, but this is good enough for now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Older zip files, created after this update will not show up in the webdav.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For some reason Infuse doesn&amp;#x27;t recognize the webdav. I honestly have no idea why. It works fine when mounting on any other device, with Rclone, on the browser, just not Infuse. I have contacted the developers for help on the issue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The logout button doesn&amp;#x27;t work for some reason. If you really want to log out, well, you can&amp;#x27;t. Just come back in a few hours and you should be logged out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Oh yeah, did I mention that Rclone is now usable with TorBox? With webdav it is! Check out &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://rclone.org/webdav/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; guide on how to do it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In depth server statistics can be viewed at our new Hetrix dashboard!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can view this data all at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://hetrix.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://hetrix.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This in depth data allows you to view everything about the servers TorBox uses. Status, Ram, Disk, CPU, and more can all be found here. This was mainly an effort to be as open as we can with our customers, this in part, allows customers to see where their money is going.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mobile&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New version of app supports cached downloads. Instead of cached downloads showing as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;inactive&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, they will be shown as cached and allowed to be downloaded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: We are aware of the slow processing speeds, as well as the slow downloads. We are scaling quickly to fix these issues, which literally just requires us to throw more money at the problem to be fixed. It is simply an issue of too many users, not enough servers. We promise, things will get better soon.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-01-25T22:14:28Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v34</link>\n            <guid>65a6094acbfec0a42d6a6f49</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A much needed update which fixes a lot of issues, and solves pricing problems for TorBox. This means that better features, more servers, faster servers and more discounts are on the way! This is a much needed step for our infrastructure with the boom in Stremio and Kodi users coming in. You can now use addons such as &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://882b9915d0fe-mediafusion.baby-beamup.club/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;MediaFusion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to instantly watch movies using TorBox on Stremio. We are also developing our own addon with the most content ever seen for a Stremio addon, which will top even Torrentio (which does not even support TorBox yet). With cached downloads becoming more of a necessity, we decided to move ahead with this. Please enjoy!&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;PS. You can now comment on these changelogs, so tell us what you think!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moves new storage to self hosted storage in Luxembourg.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Old GoFile downloads will still work until they expire. These torrents are not cached, and will not be migrated. The last GoFile link will stop working 1 month from now, on February 19, but you likely won&amp;#x27;t even notice. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(This hasn&amp;#x27;t been extensively tested as we have no way to do so on our testing servers, so for the first few hours, we will be monitoring the situation)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Brings back zipped downloads. When we moved to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; we were not able to support zipped files from there. Now that we have moved to self hosting, we are able to support zipped downloads. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads are only available for 1 hour just like normal downloads. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;As long as you start the download within the hour time limit, you won&amp;#x27;t even notice a problem.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Zipped downloads are not multi-connection, and don&amp;#x27;t tell you how long they have left to download. &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;This will be fixed eventually as we dial in our zipping in a little bit better.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zipped downloads also have a speed decrease of about 10% from our benchmarks as they are zipped on the fly, and are not pre-made (to save space and money).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cached downloads are now available forever (basically), and only get deleted if not downloaded for more than 30 days. So if you create a torrent, and it stops seeding after 24 hours, it will still be cached and available for you to download. You can even remove a torrent from your dashboard, and re-add it a few days later, and it will instantly be available for you to download. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This means that in most cases popular torrents will already be available to download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Cached downloads do not count as active downloads for anyone but free users&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. That means that if a torrent is already cached, then you won&amp;#x27;t have to wait, and it won&amp;#x27;t cost you a download spot. Active downloads now mean only downloads that are actively downloading or seeding from peers. Theoretically, if all you use are cached downloads, you can have infinite torrents available to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also means that any torrents that may be over your limit are allowed to you now if they are cached. If a Pro user already downloaded a 300gb torrent, and you also download it as a Essential user, you also have access to it. This also applies to free users. It costs us nothing to let you download already downloaded torrents so enjoy the feature :)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We hope that eventually we will have a larger cache than even Real-Debrid. We are actively working on caching the most popular torrents, so most things will be ready for you already.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OneDrive and Google Drive work a little bit better now. It seems like sometimes Google blocks the server&amp;#x27;s requests due to location, so that may be an issue to tackle in the next update.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made the site more responsive. When you pause a torrent, it will instantly be paused. Same with resuming. When you click on the download button it will now show a loading icon, while it is retrieving your download link, which leads to a better user experience. Some users were complaining about the perceived speed of the site, so this was a needed change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The quick stats only show up when you have downloads in a category that it pertains to. So if you only have active downloads, that&amp;#x27;s all that will show up. If you don&amp;#x27;t have any inactive downloads, that&amp;#x27;s all that will show up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removes notifications when you pause, resume, or delete a torrent. It just does as you say. The notifications felt redundant.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds owner to torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What this means is that if you download a cached torrent that someone is currently downloading (either in progress, or is processing), then you are not allowed to control that torrent. This only basically means that you cannot pause or resume the torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically no bug fixes!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;(has breaking changes)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;We tried our best to avoid breaking changes, but here they are. We hope it&amp;#x27;s not too inconvenient. &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Requesting download structure has changed a little bit. You no longer have to give a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;folder_id&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, but are required to specify a boolean for the new param, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;zip_link&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This allows you to get the direct link for a zipped download for the entire torrent. You can read more about it on the docs page. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29572726/2s9YXo1zX4#cc4ceac8-7cb6-4be5-bf09-f949d9e9a458&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The examples for these changes have not been updated yet, but the requests have been.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Requesting zips are no longer used, as it is mostly internal as you now need a &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;presigned_token&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; that you can&amp;#x27;t generate yourself. This has mostly been replaced by the request download endpoint, as the request zip endpoint now serves the download rather than return a link. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29572726/2s9YXo1zX4#d225fed0-6502-4bd3-8c6a-70cf802f0088&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The examples for these changes have not been updated yet, but the requests have been.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to download the zip of a torrent, simply use the request download endpoint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google Drive and OneDrive endpoints no longer require the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;folder_id&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; parameter and instead take the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;zip&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; parameter, which is a boolean stating if you want it zipped or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: Downloads will likely be (sort of) slow for the first few weeks as we build up cache and begin adding more servers. Once files have been migrated around and the load has gotten a little lighter on the first few servers, things will be a lot faster. Hopefully you never even notice it.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2024-01-20T02:18:31Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.3.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v331</link>\n            <guid>659dfc88ead9de72355c9eed</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds torrent search feature (in a minor release???). This allows you to easily search for torrents right inside TorBox. This also allows you to easily add the torrents to TorBox just by clicking on it. No more needing to go to sketchy torrent websites. Simply search on TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disables the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Stream in Player&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; button for downloads that aren&amp;#x27;t compatible. Now it only works on video and audio.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made user creation more reliable. Before, API keys might not be created for a user, rendering their experience inaccessible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moves quick stats to the top of the dashboard, rather than being out of place on the right side.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes large notifications overflowing the notifications panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds caching to data heavy routes. This will speed up requests and reduce load on the server. Caching is only for 1 hour.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds route for adding queries to the queue for the scraper to search for.

This was a much needed feature that was missing up until now! You can now easily stream your videos and your music/audio. This used to be a feature but was removed in v2. It is now back, along with other good modifications that people have been asking for!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows streaming of video and audio. Simply click the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Video Button &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;or the&amp;lt;em&amp;gt; Audio Button&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. It will take you to the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/stream&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; page. Here, simply click the play button and your stream will begin after some time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1703980784175.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1703980831150.png&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Enjoy zero buffering thanks to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows creating a high quality stream. This stream allows you to get multiple bitrates such as 480p, 720p, 1080p, and even 4k (HDR is supported). If your video is a video type that cannot be played in the browser, this also allows you to play that video. This allows you to also switch audio tracks, as well as showing subtitles and switching subtitle languages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It has a slight catch though so beware. If the video has never been watched before, it will have to go through a transcoding process which can take some time. For 30 minutes of video, it takes about 7-8 minutes for the process to be complete.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Because it can take awhile, you will receive a notification once it is finished, or if you stay on the streaming page, your page will automatically update once the process is complete.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This feature is only for testing at the moment while we figure out caching, and storage for said items. It is also considerably expensive for TorBox, as we have to save multiple versions of the video. Transcoding is also a time consuming and expensive(ish) process. It just needs more time to get right.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows getting direct streaming links for popular 3rd party apps such as VLC, Stremio, and Infuse. Also allows you to directly copy the streaming link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These links only work if you have the apps downloaded on your PC or Mobile device. We will have a guide for users on how to add these to their devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed the torrent menu popup border being cut off on the edges when having more than 3 torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows viewing the main tracker that the torrent is downloading from. You have to enable this in the settings under &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Show Main Tracker In Torrent&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed being able to click &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;reannounce&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;pause/resume&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, buttons when a torrent is inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Shows some stats when a torrent is inactive. It now shows &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;created at date&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;expired at date&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ending ratio&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;total seeded&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;size&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of the torrent. Go show off those torrents!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds footer to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Download page&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;RSS Feed page&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Streaming page&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Settings page&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Add To Download Manager&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; button on mobile devices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bans new users using the &amp;quot;period&amp;quot; trick when using Gmail emails. Previously users were able to create accounts using emails such as &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:t.o.r.b.o.x@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;t.o.r.b.o.x@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:t.orbox@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;t.orbox@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:t.o.rbox@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;t.o.rbox@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, etc. This allowed you to create 3 accounts from only one email, which is considered abuse of the system. No accounts have been banned which used this trick previously, but any accounts signing up trying to use this trick will be banned instantly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, this is not to say you can&amp;#x27;t use it, if this is the first time you are using that email, then it works fine, and you won&amp;#x27;t be banned. But if you try and use multiple of the same email, the API will see that and ban any accounts afterwards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This also applies to the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; trick. If you have an account with &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:hello+torbox@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hello+torbox@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; and now you are signing up with &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:hel.lo@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hel.lo@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:hel.lo@gmail.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;hel.lo@gmail.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot; will be banned. Works the other way around too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent status are more descriptive, such as telling you where there are no seeds, or no peers to download from.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Referrals are now copied as links that you can easily share with friends or family.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whenever a user is logged in and they click on the link, they will automatically be asked to add this referral code on top of their current one. This way they won&amp;#x27;t forget about it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Users are only asked once per session. If they for some reason deny, then they won&amp;#x27;t be asked again until they open a new browser session (Closing and opening again).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This makes referrals more simple, and less of a hassle. It was also requested by a user in the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://discord.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Discord server&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed issue with some long magnets not being added due to random error. This also fixed magnets with no name or no trackers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added backup domains (seemed fun to do and they were crazy cheap on Porkbun, so I had to cop. There is no danger for TorBox, but it is possible that other countries can block the main site.):&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.pro&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://torbox.pro&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.online&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://torbox.online&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.cloud&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://torbox.cloud&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://bakabox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://bakabox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changes site Discord links to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://discord.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://discord.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, in case the main link ever changes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Changed how emails look. Instead of just getting a text email, you now get fancy emails!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added route to get Torrent Instant Cached Availability. This was added for developers mostly who wanted a Real-Debrid like API. Simply input a hash, and it will return a True/False boolean telling you if it is cached or not. You will have to start the download yourself though. &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29572726/2s9YXo1zX4#99e1b7a7-bdf6-4884-af9d-bd9903a8ca63&amp;quot;&amp;gt;API DOCS LINK&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/torrents/checkcached&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added route to use Referral code added to a user&amp;#x27;s account using the API. This can be an incentive for developers to use make this call automatically, maybe when a user uses their app, or when they link their account, the developer can make this call and have the user use the developer&amp;#x27;s referral code.

Files being zipped accounts for 50% of the progress, the other 50% accounts for the actual upload of the file, which you won&amp;#x27;t be able to keep track of.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If the torrent fails to process for whatever reason, a notification is sent, so you aren&amp;#x27;t stuck guessing about its progress.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you navigate the the main page, &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, when you are logged in, you will be redirected to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://torbox.app/dashboard&amp;quot;&amp;gt;torbox.app/dashboard&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; instantly so you can start using TorBox faster!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;quot;You have X notifications waiting in your inbox&amp;quot; is now only shown once per session.

This issue has now been generally fixed. The problem was actually timeouts to GoFile&amp;#x27;s servers and while I had added the timeout fix to almost every GoFile upload, there were some cases (which turned into close to half of all torrents due to a lapse in judgement from me). Another problem which needed addressing is long processing times due to large file count. This has now been addressed by zipping the torrent if it has more than 20 files. Really glad to have fixed this problem on my side. Now we just wait for GoFile to handle their side and make it even more reliable, because this solution still relies on their servers to accept the files and handle them properly.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Processing hangups due to failed upload.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Processing times due to large amounts of files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-12-14T04:46:54Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v3.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v31</link>\n            <guid>6578ee269ed2047ada8ae663</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This update is solely for recovering from the v3 release and getting a few features people wanted in that were pretty simple to get to.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added progress bars for &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;downloading&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;paused&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;processing&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; torrents. This allows you to quickly see where your torrent is in the process without having to try and find the small print in the specific torrent. This makes it way easier.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Speaking of ease, a quick stats panel will appear on the left side under the download speed chart which allows you to quickly get a view on how many torrents are in your TorBox. It also shows you the status of each of those torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a real time online user count so you can see who is using TorBox with you. Not really a necessary thing but the count was already available on the relay so I decided to let you see it too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed the real time user counter on the relay api.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed downloads not being downloadable on iOS.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed queued downloads not showing up.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed RSS feeds not downloading RSS items.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed RSS scan intervals being editable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added the ability to ignore RSS items that are older than X amount of days.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes random 0 when torrent is processing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes switches in the settings page being weird and out of place on smaller displays.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Forgot Password&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Login with email&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Login with Password&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; buttons being placed out of the login space on smaller displays.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes typo with &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Availability&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; count (I didn&amp;#x27;t know what availability in torrents meant, and just slapped a % sign on there thinking it was the percentage of the file which is available which is incorrect)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes torrents not being added in some cases where the torrent file is extremely large.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mobile App&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes layout of dashboard bar where long emails pushed the buttons off of the screen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes user sign ups not granting an API negating access to the app entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes PayPal payments not getting credited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Stripe payments not getting credited.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Coinbase not accepting multiple cryptocurrencies like before (they offered me a beta without me knowing what it was, and I stupidly accepted. Opting out fixed the issue).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;API properly sends notification when user submits bad torrent file or magnet link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;NOTE: Zip files are still broken.

In v3.0 we introduce highly asked for things such as better and more integrations, queues, a mobile app, and better seeding, not to mention the dozens of bugs fixed.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Before we get any further into this absolutely monstrous set of release notes, I would first like to thank the users of my &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://discord.gg/47SnjxgBFb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Discord server&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for being able to test and give feedback on TorBox ever since the very beginning, you guys made it as good as it is today.

Only shows the first time you view the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents now show availability percentage, so you know if you are fully able to download a torrent or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents that are being processed (uploaded to GoFile) will be shown as &amp;quot;Processing&amp;quot; on the dashboard (in blue).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Removed the ability to add web downloads&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.

There were too many problems with it, and I decided to skip migrating web downloads to v3 as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Downloads (Download Page)&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Improved the Google Drive integration. Finally, Rclone is viable, as well as other cloud setups.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;No longer have to be present on the download page. Once you click the button and log in, it downloads in the background on the servers, which us much faster compared to before.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Log in is more reliable. Sometimes due to cookies, browser differences, or other weird things, you could never add the file to Google Drive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed naming of files. Before they would be URLEncoded, which made it safer, but also made the files look weird.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Faster downloads thanks to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. This also includes making all downloads resume capable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Added OneDrive integration&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Some users were requesting thanks to school or business accounts having infinite storage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Same as the Google Drive integration except for OneDrive. Simply click the button, log in, and it will begin working.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the fastest way to add your files to the cloud out of any of the integrations thanks to being able to upload 60MB at a time to the cloud rather than only 256KB in the case of Google Drive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added the ability to use the all integrations with folders (zip files). This way, for torrents with a lot of files, you can just click one button rather than many. All integrations work with the zip files (Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zip files are now support multi-connection downloads thanks to GoFile supporting it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can no longer view files on TorBox, you must go to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. The same button takes you to the specific file where you can then view the file, much like you used to do on TorBox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now share download links with others thanks to &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Simply click the share button, and the link will be copied to your clipboard, where you can share it with anyone online.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Downloads are now supplied by &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://GoFile.io&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;GoFile.io&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;This decision was made for scalability and the future of TorBox. While it sucks having to rely on another service to handle downloads for TorBox, there are many benefits to doing so.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first and most important reason for this change is that seeding/downloading speeds are much faster. With essentially no load on the hard drives (other than uploading to GoFile once), this frees up precious IOPS needed to hit high transfer speeds. Before, downloads were made from the same file that the server was seeding from meaning that the load on the drives were so much that sometimes downloads would crawl to a stop. This is no longer the case thanks to GoFile&amp;#x27;s excellent CDN and reliability, you will be able to download at or near your bandwidth speed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The second is that it gives TorBox more room to grow, thanks to a lower budget needed for servers, we can put more money into features, integrations, marketing and more for the best experience.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The final reason is scaling and the future of TorBox. If we suddenly got an onslaught of users who all downloaded more than 30TB in 24 hours, we wouldn&amp;#x27;t have been able to keep up, but with GoFile and their seemingly infinite storage, this is no longer a problem. A sudden burst wouldn&amp;#x27;t cripple the service for anyone else.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Torrents&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Prevents duplicate torrents. You can no longer have multiple of the same torrent on your dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For users on a paid plan, you can now &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;queue up as many torrents as you want&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. Simply continue to add torrents on your dashboard, even if you have hit your active limit. Once you delete a torrent, or one becomes inactive, TorBox will automatically begin downloading the next one in line (after some time delay due to the check only happening every 10 minutes or so to save processing although as soon as you delete a torrent, it will begin downloading the next one).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no limit to how many you add to the queue, they will be downloaded in order and as soon as you have available slots.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, you cannot move the order of the queue. There will be a way to modify the order in a future update.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To remove an item from the queue, simply delete it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes error on quick add page that requires you to click the Add button&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;2 times to add it, which was annoying.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;RSS Feeds&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pro users are now able to add RSS feeds and automatically download torrents (almost) as soon as they are available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RSS feeds require the following to be added:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An RSS feed URL. Must be publicly accessible. Must have .torrent link files that are also publicly accessible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A name. This can be any name, which allows you to quickly recognize what an RSS feed is.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RSS feeds can optionally have the following as well:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;download this&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; regex pattern which forces the reader to download all torrents that match this regex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ignore this&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; regex pattern which forces the read to ignore torrents that match this regex.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A scan interval which tells the API how often to check for changes in your RSS feed. The default is 60 minutes, but can go all the way down to 10 minutes if you like to stay on top of things. You can also set this to be as long as you want. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can add as many RSS feeds as you like, and downloads will be queued up if you run out of active slots.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are able to edit RSS feeds if you want to change the display name, the scan interval or the regex patterns.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You are also able to force updates, pause, resume, and delete RSS feeds. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Forcing an update simply scans the RSS feed and downloads anything new automatically.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;API&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is now a public API available. It does not have everything you need just yet, and is still in Alpha, but generally, it is ready to use, as the site itself uses it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can view documentation at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://api-docs.torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;https://api-docs.torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; or by clicking API docs under the development section of the footer anywhere it is available.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The docs are all written in Postman so you are able to run it in Postman to try it out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For most endpoints there are examples as well as variables so you can enter whatever you like there.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All users get an API key that they can use to access the API. You can view your API key in the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;quot;&amp;gt;settings page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Mobile App&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A fully featured mobile app is now available for Android devices (iOS coming soon). This allows you to take TorBox on the go with a native app, rather than using the website.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To access the app, you must have assigned a password to your account. This can be done by going to the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;quot;&amp;gt;TorBox settings page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can do everything you can do on the website, except for downloading torrents (takes you to the browser where you have to be logged in anyways) as well as managing RSS feeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The mobile app is mainly used for notifications to be received anywhere you are on your mobile device. As soon as something happens on your TorBox account, you will know about it, such as downloads being complete, errors, or payments going through. You can also quickly view your torrents as well as manage them.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;With all that said, please expect bugs and minor downtimes within the next few weeks as I get everything stable once again. Keeping a service like this has gotten so complex for just one person, so please be patient with me. Thanks all!&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-12-07T09:36:53Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.6.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v261</link>\n            <guid>6551bfb74d534fd1110aa145</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made torrent files more reliable than ever before due to new process regarding how they are handled on the server.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrent files now show the original name of the torrent file when uploading. Before it was something like: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;some_uuid-name_of_torrent&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, now it is simply the name of the torrent. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are unsubscribed from web notifications, you will no longer receive a toast about how many notifications you have in your inbox.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The zip file download button now clicks right through and only activates when you hover over it. Before, you had to click twice to open the menu, which is unsavory. Now you simply click to open the menu.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Mobile App&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Replaces popups in app with toasts, much like the website has. This way you don&amp;#x27;t have to click a confirmation button every time you modify something, or get an error.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-11-13T06:22:48Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.6</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v26</link>\n            <guid>654e9c174d534fd111cec6c7</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another new version, this time with awesome new stuff and fixes for both the mobile app and website!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Website&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Lets users know when they have a notification on the dashboard with a notifier whenever they enter the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some users were having troubles with knowing when they had a notification due to the badge being quite small and out of the way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whenever a web notification is sent, if the user does not subscribe to desktop notifications, then on the dashboard they will get a notification.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some users were having troubles knowing when they had a notification, which resulted in confusion when a torrent for instance had an error.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some devices can&amp;#x27;t get desktop notifications such as mobile devices, so this fixes the issue for mobile devices not seeing notifications as soon as they happen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;UI update with buttons. Updated all buttons on the site to be the same style to resolve some confusion on what is or is not a button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Affects the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Enable Desktop Notifications&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; button on the notifications panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Affects the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Clear All&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; button on the notifications panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Affects the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Settings&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; button on the user panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Affects the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Logout&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; button on the user panel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes a bug where a torrent would never be marked as &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Ready To Download&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; due the hash being present on another server, even if the file wasn&amp;#x27;t available on the current server.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added Reddit, Telegram, and Matrix links in the footer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds option to settings to register TorBox to handle magnet links automatically. Whenever you click on one, it will open TorBox with the magnet link so you can add it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed About page showing the correct number of satellites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Optimized seeding on torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Mobile App&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds controlling torrents using popup, much like the current website does.

Will solve some issues for bigger torrents getting bad seeds and downloading slowly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now pause and resume torrents, which will allow you to get better download speeds, or if you choose, just stop seeding to everyone.

With this version we introduce notifications and the highly asked for, passwords.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/settings&amp;quot;&amp;gt;settings page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, where you can edit notifications, your plan, and other settings as well as new ones coming soon. These settings are also all cloud saved, so they will all travel to any device you use TorBox on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to change your password by getting a password reset email.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to add more time, subscribe to a higher plan, and view the Stripe Dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to modify your notifications settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to enable/disable Email Notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to enable/disable Web Notifications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to enable/disable Mobile Notifications (which aren&amp;#x27;t available yet, but coming soon!)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to enable/disable RSS Feed Notifications as well as copy your RSS Feed link.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to modify your site settings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to show download speed in the tab name for easy viewing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Email Notifications allow you to receive notifications for everything such as payments, referrals, and downloads straight to your inbox. Is off by default to reduce spam.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Web Notifications allow you to receive notifications from the site and if the site is open, and desktop notifications are enabled, you can get desktop notifications. This is on by default and was the original way for notifications. Basically just allows you to disable viewing them if you want.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mobile Notifications will allow you to download the mobile app (coming soon!) and receive push notifications straight to your device to get the latest updates.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RSS Feed Notifications shows your notifications in an RSS feed which can be used anywhere. Useful for users who have other notifications in RSS. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Passwords are now available to add to your account, allowing you to skip sending emails every time you want to log in. Useful for users with password managers for quick logins. Also having a password will allow you to use other upcoming TorBox services such as Persistent Storage, FTP, SFTP, S3, and more!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows you to send a password reset email from going to the settings page and clicking the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Send Password Reset Email&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, or by going to the &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/forgotpw&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Forgot Password&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; page, which will allow you to enter your email and get a password reset email.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to bookmark the login page with the email/password entry bookmark &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://torbox.app/login?pwd=true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this site&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New Satellite, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Nebula, &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;a satellite specifically for our Essential and Standard Users. Before Essential, Standard and Free users all had to same the same server and that meant bandwidth too. We were running out too quickly (we went through 100TB in less than 2 weeks) so we decided to move servers around and that meant getting a new one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Stellar&amp;#x27;s download speeds (from server to your PC) has been reduced to &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;10MB/s &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;rather than full speed which was where all the bandwidth is going. Hopefully this will allow us to stretch 100TB a little further. We are planning to move to unmetered servers soon, but it&amp;#x27;s a little out of budget. If you want to help support TorBox, sign up for a paid plan!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All other servers are full speed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Squashed some bugs 🐛&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-21T03:28:57Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.4.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v244</link>\n            <guid>652f78f429630e95566ebbb4</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes oversized downloads not removing cooldown&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows for downloading web downloads from anywhere.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed bug with torrent files that had trouble uploading due to not being previously deleted.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed cached torrents not being detected correctly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed inactive downloads being cached when they weren&amp;#x27;t supposed to be.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows for torrent files to be up to 10MB big.

In the case where the torrent is already expired, then the torrent is not cached, and the user will be able to start a download like normal. Before, even expired downloads counted as cached.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Stripe upgrading/downgrading plans not taking effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents now expire properly instead of saying &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Download expires 1 week ago.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents now don&amp;#x27;t require a user to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;look&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; at it to make it inactive. Every 30 minutes all torrents are checked for expired files, as cached downloads require an accurate measurement of expired vs not expired torrents.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed download names not showing proper name or extension if downloaded too quickly through browser. &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;If you are using a download manager, you still have to wait until the file is resolved before downloading, or the name won&amp;#x27;t show up properly. This is a zero day problem and requires high optimization of the API to work perfectly. This is high on the list of things to fix.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Further small bug fixes on the website side of things.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-14T09:45:57Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.4.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v242</link>\n            <guid>65264f61aa96cf50ebe04a9e</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Moved main processes such as API and Relay to new more (overpowered) powerful server.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This will give better response times for requests so you aren&amp;#x27;t waiting as long for a torrent to be added for example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The relay will scale further allowing for it to work better and more efficiently.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The download graph to only show values above 0.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The download graph now scales properly and shows proper speeds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Better relay efficiency and stability (ie: your torrents should be properly updating now).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-11T07:34:46Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.4.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v241</link>\n            <guid>65223b812415cc0ba9fafd2f</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds proper error pages for any errors on the satellites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed Coinbase payments not giving altering user&amp;#x27;s satellite if upgrading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Optimized web pages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Main page gradient now moves a bit faster, making a cooler effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-08T05:22:01Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.4</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v24</link>\n            <guid>6520b8c5651678b3e0b87226</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Minor update that introduces TorBox&amp;#x27;s awesome new community requested plan! This release also fixes a lot of bugs that have been springing up, as well as another rewrite, this time of the relay (was not fun).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Introduces the new &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Standard Plan&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. This plan is aimed at users who want to use TorBox with private trackers who require at least a week of seeding, but don&amp;#x27;t need all of the features that the Pro plan has.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows for 5 active downloads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allows for 2 week (14 day) seeding.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Other than those 2 changes, it is the same as the Essential Plan.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rewrote the relay to allow for scalability (yes, I have already rewritten the relay once in v2.0). This time it introduces a queue, so instead of all these requests trying to be done at the same time it processes 10 at a time, per worker, meaning with scale, I could make it even faster. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mainly addresses the issues of downloads not being updated on the dashboard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Honestly, this doesn&amp;#x27;t affect the user, as it is now working exactly how it is supposed to, LOL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed Sentry bug popup. Whenever an error would happen, safe or unsafe, it would popup this window which severely impacted the user experience, as it would usually popup on &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; errors or errors that don&amp;#x27;t affect anything, which would be very annoying, so it is removed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Optimized the website, so on average it should be almost 10% faster regarding opening and closing pages. This will only really affect users on mobile devices on cellular data. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These changes aren&amp;#x27;t very noticeable, but ensures that TorBox is easy and feels good to use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-07T01:56:44Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.3.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v231</link>\n            <guid>651c744fb3c6ce97d137a32c</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds allowing to buy multiple months of service at once.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1 Month&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 Months&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;12 Months (1 Year)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Adds Discord widget allowing you to view recent Discord announcements.

Here are some improved and asked for features.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added proper tooltip for download page. Before it would still be present if you clicked on the button.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added tooltips for the following UI elements:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download &amp;quot;Created At&amp;quot; date shows exact date on hover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download &amp;quot;Expires At&amp;quot; date shows exact date on hover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For downloads with ratio &amp;quot;Ratio&amp;quot;, shows the exact ratio to the thousandths position. (0.000)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For users with a paid plan, the &amp;quot;plan expires _____&amp;quot; text shows the exact date it will expire on hover.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Referrals now actually give the deserved days. Before they weren&amp;#x27;t given to all users who entered a valid referral code.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made all payment types more reliable. Before the dates were getting messed up depending on when you made your account? That was a weird one, but it&amp;#x27;s all fixed (hopefully).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Payments were rewritten to allow for quantities for future use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the dashboard page, added a support button, which allows you to easily contact support, with resumability which means you can leave and come back whenever you want and will have responses waiting for you (this is huge, basically you can leave and the ticket will stay open). This support button also allows you to read about any problems you might have, using the articles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the dashboard page, added a feedback button, which shows the featurebase changelog and also requested features. Simply easy access for featurebase.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Made web download download speeds show on the download graph.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can now see how many total downloads you have done. This is located in the avatar button popup, below your satellite name and IP. If you have over 50 downloads, it will show a cool flame icon, showing just how on fire you are!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added a list of available links that are allowed to download using the web download feature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixed invalid web download links still giving a cooldown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added Sentry tracking for all satellites, the api, and the relay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-10-01T06:33:57Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v22</link>\n            <guid>6517c291d7f9c7dc66e3ed64</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Web Downloads! Well, at least the beginning of them. This update was mostly laying the ground work for future possibilities. Regarding changes that will actually affect you, the user, nothing major. This was more of a backend/api/database type of update, but it did add some web downloads, so that is pretty cool. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added support to download URLs from the web.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Only supports links from &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/master/supportedsites.md&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this list for now&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Download links have a new structure. Not that most people would care, but if you have links saved somewhere, and are trying to redownload them, they will fail due to the change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For torrent files: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/file/torrents/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For zipped torrents:&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; /zip/torrents/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For webdownload files:&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; /file/web_downloads/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For zipped webdownloads: &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;/zip/web_downloads/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;/&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;id&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yup, that&amp;#x27;s literally it. Like I said, nothing big regarding massive changes or features, but this is a huge stepping point for the code, and the service itself. With this change, the possibilities to add all types of downloads are endless thanks to the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;semi-modularity&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; that is built in (I will do better).&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Regarding supporting sites, I have to match specific domains to make it work, so if you have a specific site you would like to add, DM me on Discord, open a support ticket on the Discord server, or send an email at &amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;mailto:contact@torbox.app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;contact@torbox.app&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and I will see what I can do. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;No, I will not be adding sites like rapid-gator. LeechersParadise is dead and those sites are too hard to maintain. Go pay for All-Debrid or Real-Debrid. TorBox is primarily for torrents.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; 1Fichier and UpToBox may be possible, but staying on top of things for those types of sites is hard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-09-30T06:52:58Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v2.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v21</link>\n            <guid>65108a1b66279bfaa09fecad</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes PayPal problems people were having.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Coinbase problems people were having.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fixes Zip downloads for files over 4GB.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Faster Zip downloads&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Zip files now show total size.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Zip files are still not multi-connection like single downloads.

It has been a lot of bug fixes. A lot of new features. A lot of new designs. Here are some interesting stats:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Frontend&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;37 hours, 2 minutes spent coding&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;169 commits&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Backend&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;63 hours, 7 minutes spent coding&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;194 commits&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;#x27;s a lot of time to get to this point. Its something to be proud of though. So far the service is the best looking UI I have ever built, thanks to Fero. Not just the design, but other than a few other projects, (and after the rewrite) this is my most bullet proof API as well. It was a lot to get to this point, but I want to thank everyone in my Discord as well as other service who gave me very constructive advice and bugs to fix. All that time together, we have created something awesome and something that I believe will last for a long time. Enough with the gushy stuff, here is what has changed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The IDM and Jdownloader buttons have been combined into one &amp;quot;Add to Download Manager&amp;quot; button. This also &amp;quot;allows&amp;quot; user for users who like pyload or downthemall without making things confusing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloading folders is a little bit more intuitive and user friendly thanks to the popup. You can now see exactly what buttons do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The &amp;quot;Currently ______&amp;quot; text on the torrents has been made a little bit more intuitive and user friendly as some of the previous statuses were a little difficult to understand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents are now triple checked before being marked as &amp;quot;Inactive&amp;quot; and not being allowed to download anymore.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents on the dashboard actually update now. IDK what I did to break it, but it&amp;#x27;s fixed now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Rewrote the satellite network to be more like a cluster rather than forcing a torrent to only go to one satellite. Instead its now distributed based off of load, storage space, and other factors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You now get web notifications when the torrent has gone inactive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added bot detection using Cloudflare&amp;#x27;s turnstile for logging in.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When adding torrrents, only free user&amp;#x27;s have to wait for the captcha to complete. If you are on a paid plan, you get to skip the captcha process (takes less than 5 seconds).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The satellite relays can now handle &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;infinite&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; users rather than crashing on high load.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am excited to continue working on this project, and hopefully the launch on Reddit in a few days goes well.

Unless they are court ordered and I am required to give up logs for the download clients, then it is very unlikely that I will be able to even do anything about the DMCA requests. If I can, I will email the user whose account received the DMCA request, and ask them to remove the torrent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Ratio for torrents is no uncapped.

After the first wave of users, crashing and errors were so common, that I decided to just rewrite the API, the Relay, and the Satellites. This was the only way as I wrote sloppy code as I never expected TorBox to be this popular and working on a sloppy codebase was taking longer to fix bugs than just rewriting, so I did just that. This also was a big change as it changed how I was storing files. Before, I just zipped the files and stored them to be accessible, which worked out fine, but that cuts the storage space I have to work with in half. Obviously this is not going to work as the only way to keep this service alive is to keep pricing low, which means storing files as efficiently as possible. This update changed that.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Downloads were all wiped due to complete schema change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed Nebula Satellite&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added Quasar Satellite&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Torrents are no longer stored as zips. Rather they are stored as their raw files, which allows downloads to be much faster and more efficiently store files.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Allowed 16 connections per IP rather than allowing 8 per download.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed torrent file picker, as it introduced too much complexity, and usually was only used to squeeze under the 100gb limit for free and essential users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Removed email notifications. This will be back later. Currently only notifications on the website are sent.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This patch was actually made on 9/10/2023.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-09-20T21:45:17Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v1.2</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v12-2</link>\n            <guid>650b65a48fd5d499ff277396</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added PayPal payments&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Added referral codes for account bonuses&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This patch was actually made 9/4/2023&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-09-20T21:36:42Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v1.1.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v111</link>\n            <guid>650b65628fd5d499ff27520c</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Magnet downloads are fixed&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;This patch was actually made 9/3/2023&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>\n            <pubDate>2023-09-20T21:35:24Z</pubDate>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title>v1.1</title>\n            <link>https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v11</link>\n            <guid>650b64368fd5d499ff26ced4</guid>\n            <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is everything that has changed since the v1.0 launch on Discord to a few servers.

This is where you can access the new Bring Your Own Indexer (BYOI as the community has been calling it) settings. This allows you to add your own indexers or trackers using the NZBHydra2, Jackett or Prowlarr self-hosted apps.</p><ul><li><p>This allows you to get personalized torrents and Usenet results from your own trackers, removing reliance on TorBox’s own search indexers and providers.</p></li><li><p>This also allows you to stream private torrents from apps like Stremio which use TorBox’s search engine. This is a never before seen feature.</p></li><li><p>Like mentioned, it works with torrents and Usenet and adding new search engines is very easy.</p></li><li><p>It works using the API too, so you (and developers) don’t have to do anything extra to use it with existing apps that already use the TorBox Voyager search engine.</p></li><li><p>Shows the available indexers that it will use.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Added a manual switch in the Search settings for using the BYOI feature in Stremio, as not everyone may want it in Stremio, as it may create longer loading times. This is off by default.</p></li><li><p>Added a switch in the Stremio settings for using the legacy “Your Media” in the Stremio addon discover page. (More on this in the Stremio section).</p></li><li><p>Added a switch in the Stremio settings for sorting what type of streams are shown first. You can now choose whether you want Usenet or torrent results first in the list.</p></li><li><p>Added a switch in the Integration settings for WebDAV labeled, “WebDAV Use Local Files”. This allows you to use the CDN, or not when downloading from the WebDAV. Depending on how you use the WebDAV service, it may be necessary to enable this setting. More information can be found on the settings page.</p></li><li><p>Fixed mass deleting queued downloads in the settings page.</p></li><li><p>Adds back Crypto payments which are now being processed through <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"link\\\" href=\\\"http://NowPayments.io\\\">NowPayments.io</a> due to <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"link\\\" href=\\\"http://Sellix.io\\\">Sellix.io</a> being taken down.</p></li><li><p>The dashboard now properly updates when you “Stop Seeding” a torrent.</p></li><li><p>Added clarification about per link size limits on the <a target=\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"link\\\" href=\\\"https://torbox.app/hosters\\\">Hosters page</a>.</p></li><li><p>Makes it easier to long tap on an item on the dashboard for iOS mobile devices which wanted to select text rather than hold on an item. It will now show the context menu more reliably.</p></li><li><p>All downloads now show a distinguished “Cached XXX ago” and “Created XXX ago”. This is to better tell how long ago an item was cached, while also not messing up the dashboard.</p></li></ul><h2>Stremio Addon</h2><ul><li><p>The Stremio addon can use the BYOI feature recently introduced. Make sure you enable it in the settings.</p></li><li><p>New “Your Media” section (discover page).</p><ul><li><p>This now shows posters relating to the media rather than basic TorBox posters with text.</p></li><li><p>Multiple media downloads which relate to the same media will be placed together in the Your Media section. When clicking on a Your Media item, it will now show the proper listing for content based on Season and Episode (if TV) or list the watchable files inside of the media download if a movie.</p></li><li><p>It now shows full metadata for download items including year, description and even rating.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RE-INSTALL YOUR TORBOX STREMIO ADDON TO WORK PROPERLY.</em></strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p>“Your Media” in the stream selection page is now more reliable and works even if the torrent/Usenet files are not named properly, it will still match in most cases.</p></li><li><p>You can now sort by torrent or Usenet in the streams selection page. This allows you to show either torrents or Usenet downloads first. This can be useful, especially for Pro users who only want to stream Usenet downloads.</p></li><li><p>The addon now uses CDN selection when streaming. Previously it only used the EU when streaming if on the default (Auto) setting. Setting manually used the CDN.</p></li><li><p>Better streaming performance, less buffering, and shorter start times for most users.</p></li><li><p>Play next episode now works properly in the addon allowing users to get the Stremio popup for getting the next episode, even inside of “Your Media” listings.</p></li><li><p>Usenet items now properly show as cached if another user has them cached.</p></li></ul><h2>WebDAV</h2><ul><li><p>Speed improvements regarding listing files. It no longer requires the filesystem to list files meaning it is very quick due to using the database only. Users with large libraries should no longer time out when viewing their files.</p></li><li><p>Allows using the CDN when downloading files. This increases reliability, and heavily increases download speed especially for users requiring a CDN to download quickly. This makes streaming over the WebDAV insanely quick now.</p><ul><li><p>Your may get 429 errors when downloading large folders. This is due to the connection limit and request speed when downloading many files at the same time from our CDN which is rate limited and connection limited. We recommend sticking to 1 connection in these cases.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Search API</h2><ul><li><p>The search API now includes Torrentio when searching for torrents via ID. Torentio has many good sources and is very fast, so it is being used as a backup.</p></li><li><p>Parameter to enable user search engines when searching the API, <code>search_user_engines</code>. This will increase the amount of time taken (as you are waiting for responses from more places, and disable caching on any results. <a target=\\\"\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/sgwtp70/get-torrent-data?tab=params\\\">API DOCS</a>.</p><ul><li><p>This uses the user’s search engines which they have configured in their settings to search for the torrents/Usenet requests you specify.

This is where you can access the new Bring Your Own Indexer (BYOI as the community has been calling it) settings. This allows you to add your own indexers or trackers using the NZBHydra2, Jackett or Prowlarr self-hosted apps.\\n    - This allows you to get personalized torrents and Usenet results from your own trackers, removing reliance on TorBox’s own search indexers and providers.\\n    - This also allows you to stream private torrents from apps like Stremio which use TorBox’s search engine. This is a never before seen feature.\\n    - Like mentioned, it works with torrents and Usenet and adding new search engines is very easy.\\n    - It works using the API too, so you (and developers) don’t have to do anything extra to use it with existing apps that already use the TorBox Voyager search engine.\\n    - Shows the available indexers that it will use.\\n    \\n- Added a manual switch in the Search settings for using the BYOI feature in Stremio, as not everyone may want it in Stremio, as it may create longer loading times. This is off by default.\\n- Added a switch in the Stremio settings for using the legacy “Your Media” in the Stremio addon discover page. (More on this in the Stremio section).\\n- Added a switch in the Stremio settings for sorting what type of streams are shown first. You can now choose whether you want Usenet or torrent results first in the list.\\n- Added a switch in the Integration settings for WebDAV labeled, “WebDAV Use Local Files”. This allows you to use the CDN, or not when downloading from the WebDAV. Depending on how you use the WebDAV service, it may be necessary to enable this setting. More information can be found on the settings page.\\n- Fixed mass deleting queued downloads in the settings page.\\n- Adds back Crypto payments which are now being processed through [NowPayments.io](http://NowPayments.io) due to [Sellix.io](http://Sellix.io) being taken down.\\n- The dashboard now properly updates when you “Stop Seeding” a torrent.\\n- Added clarification about per link size limits on the [Hosters page](https://torbox.app/hosters).\\n- Makes it easier to long tap on an item on the dashboard for iOS mobile devices which wanted to select text rather than hold on an item. It will now show the context menu more reliably.\\n- All downloads now show a distinguished “Cached XXX ago” and “Created XXX ago”. This is to better tell how long ago an item was cached, while also not messing up the dashboard.\\n\\n## Stremio Addon\\n- The Stremio addon can use the BYOI feature recently introduced. Make sure you enable it in the settings.\\n- New “Your Media” section (discover page).\\n    - This now shows posters relating to the media rather than basic TorBox posters with text.\\n    - Multiple media downloads which relate to the same media will be placed together in the Your Media section. When clicking on a Your Media item, it will now show the proper listing for content based on Season and Episode (if TV) or list the watchable files inside of the media download if a movie.\\n    - It now shows full metadata for download items including year, description and even rating.\\n    - ***NOTE: THIS REQUIRES YOU TO RE-INSTALL YOUR TORBOX STREMIO ADDON TO WORK PROPERLY.***\\n    \\n- “Your Media” in the stream selection page is now more reliable and works even if the torrent/Usenet files are not named properly, it will still match in most cases.\\n- You can now sort by torrent or Usenet in the streams selection page. This allows you to show either torrents or Usenet downloads first. This can be useful, especially for Pro users who only want to stream Usenet downloads.\\n- The addon now uses CDN selection when streaming. Previously it only used the EU when streaming if on the default (Auto) setting. Setting manually used the CDN.\\n- Better streaming performance, less buffering, and shorter start times for most users.\\n- Play next episode now works properly in the addon allowing users to get the Stremio popup for getting the next episode, even inside of “Your Media” listings.\\n- Usenet items now properly show as cached if another user has them cached.\\n\\n## WebDAV\\n- Speed improvements regarding listing files. It no longer requires the filesystem to list files meaning it is very quick due to using the database only. Users with large libraries should no longer time out when viewing their files.\\n- Allows using the CDN when downloading files. This increases reliability, and heavily increases download speed especially for users requiring a CDN to download quickly. This makes streaming over the WebDAV insanely quick now.\\n    - Your may get 429 errors when downloading large folders. This is due to the connection limit and request speed when downloading many files at the same time from our CDN which is rate limited and connection limited. We recommend sticking to 1 connection in these cases.\\n    \\n\\n## Search API\\n- The search API now includes Torrentio when searching for torrents via ID. Torentio has many good sources and is very fast, so it is being used as a backup.\\n- Parameter to enable user search engines when searching the API, `search_user_engines`. This will increase the amount of time taken (as you are waiting for responses from more places, and disable caching on any results. [API DOCS](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/sgwtp70/get-torrent-data?tab=params).\\n    - This uses the user’s search engines which they have configured in their settings to search for the torrents/Usenet requests you specify. All work with ID or query.\\n    \\n- Minor speed optimizations when searching for torrents.\\n\\n## Web Downloads / Debrid\\n- Fixes Mediafire downloader due to Cloudflare protections.\\n- Fixes NHentai downloader due to Cloudflare protections.\\n- Fixes Qiwi downloader due to Cloudflare protections.\\n- Adds [Bunkr](https://bunkr.cr) downloader. A popular filehoster primarily used for pornography. Known for having lots of ads on its pages, so using TorBox to reliably and safely download from Bunkr is great.\\n- Adds [MegaUp](https://megaup.net) downloader. A popular filehoster. Known for having lots of ads and malware on its pages, so using TorBox to reliably and safely download from MegaUp is great.\\n- Adds Anna’s Archive downloader. This is a popular library file hoster with the internet’s largest collection of books freely available to download. TorBox downloads these files extremely fast, which is usually limited to donating users to the site.\\n- Makes Baidu downloader more reliable.\\n    - Baidu does not show download speeds or any download status.\\n    \\n- Makes DDownload downloader more reliable.\\n- Fixes Datanodes downloader due to new changes.\\n- Better status updates when something fails due to Cloudflare protections.\\n- Overall better reliability of the web downloads system.\\n- Fixes Filer downloader.\\n- Fixes SpankBang downloader.\\n- Fixes Coomer downloader.\\n- Pixeldrain lists and directories can now be downloaded from and added to TorBox.\\n- Adds many more supported hosters.\\n\\n*NOTE: We are aware of *[*Mega.nz*](http://Mega.nz)* downloader issues.

DOWNLOAD003 was kept due to the good deal. <span data-name=\\\"grin\\\" data-type=\\\"emoji\\\">😁</span>\\n    \\n\\n### **FTP**\\n- Fixes compatibility with RClone.\\n- <u>There is a known issue with Infuse not working with FTP</u>\\n    . It will constantly load, and no video will play. We recommend using the TorBox WebDAV instead.\\n\\n### **Stremio Addon**\\n- Fixes duplicated downloads being added on uncached streams.\\n- Listing speed increases due to more optimized code.\\n- Fixed bug where on first search, there would be little to no results, but when you came back, there would be more. First search now provides the same amount of results.\\n- Fixed size and seeders have no value.\\n- Removed peers from description. Didn’t really matter.\\n- Searches have way more results!\\n- Streams now have much more accurate data. This includes language, resolution and quality. This is due to our fork of [TheBeastLT’s Parser](https://github.com/TheBeastLT/parse-torrent-title) (known and used for Torrentio Stremio Addon). We were previously using their parser for our own addon.\\n    - We were unhappy with the results, so thanks to help from [PTT by Dreulavelle](https://github.com/dreulavelle/PTT/tree/main), we have amazingly accurate data in the Stremio addon now!\\n    - I guess you can say that we are now better than Torrentio (even though we already were).\\n    - You can view and even possibly contribute to the code [here](https://github.com/TorBox-App/parse-torrent-title).\\n    \\n\\n\",\n            \"link\": \"https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v46\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2024-08-02T03:51:42Z\",\n            \"id\": \"66934f622e0a7f0da0bd85a1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"v4.5\",\n            \"html\": \"<h3><strong>Service</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Fixed service!

The biggest things to mention are all the new integrations that TorBox now has. You are now able to upload your files directly to Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox, 1Fichier, GoFile, and soon Mega. You are now also able to add links directly to JDownloader2. Along with uploading and downloading files, we now have a JDownloader2 plugin! Thank you to the JDownloader2 team for creating this! There are a ton of other new integrations that we will go over below. This is also a \\\"Fix everything\\\" version. We fixed so many glaring issues with the service, which we are very happy about.</p><h3><strong>Website</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>Fixes \\\"Open in Player\\\" button to show the drop down properly on all devices.</p></li><li><p>Fixes \\\"Open in Stremio\\\" button not working properly.</p></li><li><p>Changes \\\"Open in Download Manager\\\" button to \\\"Copy Link\\\" button.</p></li><li><p>Fixes links properly copying on Firefox and Safari browsers.</p></li><li><p>Changes look and feel of notification popups. They now group up and show on top of each other. This change saved us over 1000 lines of code in total, across the entire website, and it is a lot simpler for us to now make changes to the look and feel of notification popups. More work will be done on these in the future.</p></li><li><p>Allows you to pass a password to the debrid. You can now download files with passwords from hosters. Of course, this is optional for files not requiring a password.</p></li><li><p>Fixes quick add page not adding torrents.</p></li><li><p>Changes look of download buttons on the download page. Shows status of transfers on the button depending on the download.</p><img class=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568130225..png\\\"></li><li><p>Allows you to download a file directly to JDownloader. On the download page, simply click the \\\"Add to JDownloader\\\" button, and it will open JDownloader2 (assuming the application is already open on your computer) and will prompt you asking if you want to add the link. This button saves you a step, rather than clicking on Copy Link, opening the app, and going through all the steps, this is a simple button.</p></li><li><p>Google Drive, Onedrive, and Dropbox integrations are a lot more simplified.</p><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>For Google Drive, it will work mostly the same, simply click \\\"Add to Google Drive\\\" and it will open a popup (or new window/tab) asking you to choose an account, and give permissions to TorBox to access your Drive. It will then begin uploading to Google Drive.</p></li><li><p>For Onedrive, the process has been simplified greatly. Before, you had to (for some reason) click and log in multiple times. This time around, it's a single login, like it should have been.</p></li><li><p>For Dropbox, this is the biggest change, login is simplified, like all the others. You no longer can select a folder like before, it simply uploads everything to it's own \\\"<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"http://TorBox.app\\\">TorBox.app\\\"</a> folder. While some might not appreciate this, it allows all files to be organized where they came from. The other big change is that it no longer requires you to upload the file using your own internet. Before, your internet acted as a proxy that downloaded from TorBox, and uploaded to Dropbox. This was slow, and prevented you from leaving the page, unless you no longer wanted your download. Now, just like all the integrations, uses TorBox's own high speed servers to upload directly to Dropbox's servers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Added 1Fichier integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to 1Fichier and get a link that takes you directly to the 1Fichier download page. With this you can also define a folder along with a login token in the <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://torbox.app/settings\\\">TorBox settings</a>, that allows you to put your files wherever you want in your 1Fichier account. You can also define a password when uploading to 1Fichier (This is only available via API at this time).</p></li><li><p>Added GoFile integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to GoFile and get a link that takes you directly to the GoFile download page. You can also define your API key and a folder in the TorBox settings so you can put your files wherever you want.</p></li><li><p>The new <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://torbox.app/integrations\\\">integrations page</a> shows off all of TorBox's amazing integrations in an easy to digest way, allowing you to view the pages, and authors, as well as a basic description of the integration and what you might use it for.</p><img class=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718567924927..png\\\"></li><li><p>Adds section to landing page about integrations with a button taking you to the integrations page, we are pretty happy with how this turned out.</p><img class=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568009521..png\\\"></li><li><p>Fixed a small edge case where the allow zip switch wouldn't be switched the same as the settings if opening and closing the Add Torrent popup.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Service</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>Fixed some RSS feeds not working properly due to links not being accessible, due to redirects or others. The API will now follow redirects to be able to cater to more types of RSS feeds, rather than standard ones.</p></li><li><p>Fixed previously missed RSS feed items from never downloading. The API will now check all of your previously, not downloaded, and not ignored RSS items for new torrents.</p></li><li><p>Background tasks now run properly. These are invisible tasks that are crucial to the service staying afloat, and previously they were crashing, getting cancelled for some random reason, or other things that were preventing them from running.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Payments</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>We finally made the move to Sellix subscriptions. All Stripe subscriptions were cancelled and users were advised to switch to our new subscription system, as to not lose service.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Integrations</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven\\\">Riven</a>, a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid\\\">Plex-Debrid</a> rewrite has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use TorBox with Plex simply and easily using a simple app, either self-hosted, or hosted using an external service such as <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://store.elfhosted.com/product/riven\\\">ElfHosted</a>. We will be writing a guide on how to integrate and setup Riven with TorBox soon.</p></li><li><p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/Ferrite-iOS/Ferrite\\\">Ferrite</a>, a media search engine, which allows you to add searched items to a debrid, has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use a Stremio alternative, on iOS devices. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use Ferrite with TorBox soon.</p></li><li><p><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://jdownloader.org/\\\">JDownloader2</a>, one of the most popular download managers has created a TorBox plugin, that allows you to use pretty much all of TorBox's features, right from the JDownloader application! You don't even need to use the TorBox website if you wanted to. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox. <strong>THIS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. </strong><em>If you encounter bugs, please report it to us or the JDownloader team.</em></p></li><li><p>Using TorBox with the *arr apps is now possible! Thanks to <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/westsurname/scripts/tree/main\\\">this application created by West</a>, you can now use TorBox with your already existing arr apps! It is a little complicated to get set up, but we will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox.</p></li><li><p>Like mentioned above, we now have 1Fichier and GoFile integrations, which work seamlessly with TorBox. We are also working on a Mega integration as well.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Stremio Addon</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>The TorBox stremio addon now gets searches from Torrentio and other existing search APIs, as well as it's own. This is due to the amount of complaints we get about quality as well as loading speed with our own search API. While we are very proud of our own APIs, it is very obvious that we haven't spent as much time perfecting the search as Torrentio or other search APIs have. We want to provide the best experience possible for our users, so even if that means not using our own home grown solutions, we will do it, so we have. Results should be nearly identical to Torrentio, but will all the added features of TorBox's Stremio addon.</p></li><li><p>Fixed filtering and gave more results to addon due to bad parsing.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Discord Bot</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>Fixed handling torrents that don't have a name attached. Before, the application would crash trying to split up a torrent magnet. This is no longer an issue.</p></li></ul><p><strong>WebDAV</strong></p><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>Slightly increased responsiveness and decreased response times (this is a good thing). Average response time dropped from 25 seconds (uncached) to about 12 seconds (uncached), and from 12 seconds (cached) to about 7 seconds (cached). We would call that a success! The change was that each file was being hashed (getting the MD5) every time the file was part of a request. This is exceptionally inefficient, luckily this has been fixed.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>API</strong></h3><ul class=\\\"tight\\\" data-tight=\\\"true\\\"><li><p>BREAKING CHANGE: There is no longer any endpoints for adding to Google Drive, and Onedrive from the <code>/torrents</code>, <code>/webdl</code> and <code>/usenet</code> endpoints.</p></li><li><p>BREAKING CHANGE: For the <code>/checkcached</code> endpoint, if there are no cached results found, the data key will only show null rather than an object. <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/example/29572726-400c4b83-2e6c-407e-9614-237a12aa787d\\\">API DOCS</a>.</p><p><em>NEW:</em></p><pre><code>{\\n   \\\"success\\\": true,\\n   \\\"detail\\\": \\\"No cached data found.\\\",\\n   \\\"data\\\": null\\n}</code></pre><p><em>OLD:</em></p><pre><code>{\\n   \\\"success\\\": true,\\n   \\\"detail\\\": \\\"No cached data found.\\\",\\n   \\\"data\\\": {\\n      \\\"data\\\": false\\n   }\\n}</code></pre></li><li><p>You are now able get the files inside of the cached torrent/web download/usenet download.

The biggest things to mention are all the new integrations that TorBox now has. You are now able to upload your files directly to Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox, 1Fichier, GoFile, and soon Mega. You are now also able to add links directly to JDownloader2. Along with uploading and downloading files, we now have a JDownloader2 plugin! Thank you to the JDownloader2 team for creating this! There are a ton of other new integrations that we will go over below. This is also a \\\"Fix everything\\\" version. We fixed so many glaring issues with the service, which we are very happy about.\\n### **Website**\\n- Fixes \\\"Open in Player\\\" button to show the drop down properly on all devices.\\n- Fixes \\\"Open in Stremio\\\" button not working properly.\\n- Changes \\\"Open in Download Manager\\\" button to \\\"Copy Link\\\" button.\\n- Fixes links properly copying on Firefox and Safari browsers.\\n- Changes look and feel of notification popups. They now group up and show on top of each other. This change saved us over 1000 lines of code in total, across the entire website, and it is a lot simpler for us to now make changes to the look and feel of notification popups. More work will be done on these in the future.\\n- Allows you to pass a password to the debrid. You can now download files with passwords from hosters. Of course, this is optional for files not requiring a password.\\n- Fixes quick add page not adding torrents.\\n- Changes look of download buttons on the download page. Shows status of transfers on the button depending on the download.\\n![Image](https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568130225..png)\\n- Allows you to download a file directly to JDownloader. On the download page, simply click the \\\"Add to JDownloader\\\" button, and it will open JDownloader2 (assuming the application is already open on your computer) and will prompt you asking if you want to add the link. This button saves you a step, rather than clicking on Copy Link, opening the app, and going through all the steps, this is a simple button.\\n- Google Drive, Onedrive, and Dropbox integrations are a lot more simplified.\\n    - For Google Drive, it will work mostly the same, simply click \\\"Add to Google Drive\\\" and it will open a popup (or new window/tab) asking you to choose an account, and give permissions to TorBox to access your Drive. It will then begin uploading to Google Drive.\\n    - For Onedrive, the process has been simplified greatly. Before, you had to (for some reason) click and log in multiple times. This time around, it's a single login, like it should have been.\\n    - For Dropbox, this is the biggest change, login is simplified, like all the others. You no longer can select a folder like before, it simply uploads everything to it's own \\\"[TorBox.app\\\"](http://TorBox.app) folder. While some might not appreciate this, it allows all files to be organized where they came from. The other big change is that it no longer requires you to upload the file using your own internet. Before, your internet acted as a proxy that downloaded from TorBox, and uploaded to Dropbox. This was slow, and prevented you from leaving the page, unless you no longer wanted your download. Now, just like all the integrations, uses TorBox's own high speed servers to upload directly to Dropbox's servers.\\n    \\n- Added 1Fichier integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to 1Fichier and get a link that takes you directly to the 1Fichier download page. With this you can also define a folder along with a login token in the [TorBox settings](https://torbox.app/settings), that allows you to put your files wherever you want in your 1Fichier account. You can also define a password when uploading to 1Fichier (This is only available via API at this time).\\n- Added GoFile integration. Allows you to directly upload your files to GoFile and get a link that takes you directly to the GoFile download page. You can also define your API key and a folder in the TorBox settings so you can put your files wherever you want.\\n- The new [integrations page](https://torbox.app/integrations) shows off all of TorBox's amazing integrations in an easy to digest way, allowing you to view the pages, and authors, as well as a basic description of the integration and what you might use it for.\\n![Image](https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718567924927..png)\\n- Adds section to landing page about integrations with a button taking you to the integrations page, we are pretty happy with how this turned out.\\n![Image](https://fb-usercontent.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/1718568009521..png)\\n- Fixed a small edge case where the allow zip switch wouldn't be switched the same as the settings if opening and closing the Add Torrent popup.\\n\\n### **Service**\\n- Fixed some RSS feeds not working properly due to links not being accessible, due to redirects or others. The API will now follow redirects to be able to cater to more types of RSS feeds, rather than standard ones.\\n- Fixed previously missed RSS feed items from never downloading. The API will now check all of your previously, not downloaded, and not ignored RSS items for new torrents.\\n- Background tasks now run properly. These are invisible tasks that are crucial to the service staying afloat, and previously they were crashing, getting cancelled for some random reason, or other things that were preventing them from running.\\n\\n### **Payments**\\n- We finally made the move to Sellix subscriptions. All Stripe subscriptions were cancelled and users were advised to switch to our new subscription system, as to not lose service.\\n\\n### **Integrations**\\n- [Riven](https://github.com/rivenmedia/riven), a [Plex-Debrid](https://github.com/itsToggle/plex_debrid) rewrite has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use TorBox with Plex simply and easily using a simple app, either self-hosted, or hosted using an external service such as [ElfHosted](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/riven). We will be writing a guide on how to integrate and setup Riven with TorBox soon.\\n- [Ferrite](https://github.com/Ferrite-iOS/Ferrite), a media search engine, which allows you to add searched items to a debrid, has added TorBox as a debrid! This allows you to use a Stremio alternative, on iOS devices. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use Ferrite with TorBox soon.\\n- [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/), one of the most popular download managers has created a TorBox plugin, that allows you to use pretty much all of TorBox's features, right from the JDownloader application! You don't even need to use the TorBox website if you wanted to. We will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox. **THIS IS CURRENTLY IN BETA. ***If you encounter bugs, please report it to us or the JDownloader team.*\\n- Using TorBox with the \\\\*arr apps is now possible! Thanks to [this application created by West](https://github.com/westsurname/scripts/tree/main), you can now use TorBox with your already existing arr apps! It is a little complicated to get set up, but we will be writing a guide on how to install and use it with TorBox.\\n- Like mentioned above, we now have 1Fichier and GoFile integrations, which work seamlessly with TorBox. We are also working on a Mega integration as well.\\n\\n### **Stremio Addon**\\n- The TorBox stremio addon now gets searches from Torrentio and other existing search APIs, as well as it's own. This is due to the amount of complaints we get about quality as well as loading speed with our own search API. While we are very proud of our own APIs, it is very obvious that we haven't spent as much time perfecting the search as Torrentio or other search APIs have. We want to provide the best experience possible for our users, so even if that means not using our own home grown solutions, we will do it, so we have. Results should be nearly identical to Torrentio, but will all the added features of TorBox's Stremio addon.\\n- Fixed filtering and gave more results to addon due to bad parsing.\\n\\n### **Discord Bot**\\n- Fixed handling torrents that don't have a name attached. Before, the application would crash trying to split up a torrent magnet. This is no longer an issue.\\n\\n**WebDAV**\\n- Slightly increased responsiveness and decreased response times (this is a good thing). Average response time dropped from 25 seconds (uncached) to about 12 seconds (uncached), and from 12 seconds (cached) to about 7 seconds (cached). We would call that a success! The change was that each file was being hashed (getting the MD5) every time the file was part of a request. This is exceptionally inefficient, luckily this has been fixed.\\n\\n### **API**\\n- BREAKING CHANGE: There is no longer any endpoints for adding to Google Drive, and Onedrive from the `/torrents`, `/webdl` and `/usenet` endpoints.\\n- BREAKING CHANGE: For the `/checkcached` endpoint, if there are no cached results found, the data key will only show null rather than an object. [API DOCS](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/example/29572726-400c4b83-2e6c-407e-9614-237a12aa787d).\\n    *NEW:*\\n    ```\\n    {\\n       \\\"success\\\": true,\\n       \\\"detail\\\": \\\"No cached data found.\\\",\\n       \\\"data\\\": null\\n    }\\n    ```\\n    *OLD:*\\n    ```\\n    {\\n       \\\"success\\\": true,\\n       \\\"detail\\\": \\\"No cached data found.\\\",\\n       \\\"data\\\": {\\n          \\\"data\\\": false\\n       }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n- You are now able get the files inside of the cached torrent/web download/usenet download. This works on any of the `/checkcached`endpoints (as all do the exact same thing). This can be used for more rich data to show to your users. It shows the name of the file, as well as the size of the file in bytes. [API DOCS](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/example/29572726-b54f77d3-e064-4b65-923f-a0e75e8ed2b5).\\n- You are now able to pass in a password to web downloads. This allows you to unlock a file if necessary. [API DOCS](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/request/29572726-ffb01e39-ebdf-4983-9483-f1907a37a133?tab=body).\\n- You can now request user settings when viewing user data at `/me`.

[API DOCS](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/example/29572726-1c171121-b145-4d71-82cd-db07f79091e7).\\n- New `/integrations` main route has all of the integration endpoints. This is where the Google Drive and OneDrive upload endpoint have been moved. It also adds all of the other integrations, OAuth, and Jobs.

Previously it would simply say \\\"Torrent rejected by the server\\\".\\n- Better reliability when getting the torrent hash.\\n- Better reliability with debrid links.\\n- Brings back MD5 hashes to files. This was requested by users, as well as for the future of TorBox as we will now be checking for viruses (simple, non-intrusive, and non-removing, acts more as a \\\"hey this torrent has a virus, watch out\\\", not a \\\"this torrent has a virus and you are not allowed to download it\\\" type of vibe), and the simplest way is by MD5 hash.\\n\\n### **Website**\\n- Fixed web downloads *(debrid downloads)* not showing progress even though they were downloading just fine.\\n\\n***KNOWN ISSUE: ****We are aware of the issues with *[*storage.torbox.app*](http://storage.torbox.app)*. This is a result of not having enough servers to meet the download demands of all of our users during peak hours. We are quickly working on scaling to be able to handle the load. You may notice for a few minutes that the storage is completely inaccessible. We apologize for this inconvenience.

This means that now, not only is TorBox cheaper, but has more features than RD, which is pretty cool.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>New tools page</strong>. This page has a lot of interesting and useful tools for your journey torrenting with TorBox.</p><ul><li><p>The first tool is a magnet link to torrent file converter. Simply put your magnet link into the text box and click the submit button. After a few seconds, your device will automatically start downloading the newly generated torrent file.</p><ul><li><p>This requires the website to interact with TorBox's API to retrieve metadata about the torrent, which is why it can take a decent amount of time.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The next tool is exactly the opposite, it takes a torrent file, and gives you a magnet link. Unlike the previous converter, this one is nearly instant, giving you a magnet link extremely quickly.</p></li><li><p>The final tool is a button that generates your VPN WireGuard configuration! This means that you can download the configuration on any device, and use TorBox's VPN on any device as well.

We use Cloudflare servers to route traffic, so your information is private, fast, and always connected near you. This also will increase your download speeds from TorBox as TorBox runs on the Cloudflare network as well. Using the TorBox VPN is like having a direct connection to TorBox's servers. Pretty neat huh?</p></li><li><p>If you have been having slow downloads, buffering, or anything similar to that, try out the VPN.</p></li><li><p>You are only able to use this VPN on 4 devices total before devices start swapping spaces.

This saves you and TorBox bandwidth, and decreases the risk of downloads failing when downloading a zip later on. This does come with a penalty in processing time, as the server needs time to prematurely zip all of those files. At least it is doing it in a safe environment, where nothing will break compared to a high bandwidth and fluctuating environment.</p></li><li><p>All paid users have access to our TorBox VPN.

Introducing v4.0, where the major features include, Usenet, Web Downloads (Debrid), a rewritten storage API, and a more stable and reliable service. Along with major features, our infrastructure has changed significantly, and we are pretty much at endgame setup, so things are just scaling up from here.</p><h3><strong><em>Website</em></strong></h3><ul><li><p>Adds a Add NZB button to the dashboard. This allows you to add an NZB link or file that will then download the files from the Usenet. The files received from usenet will then be available to download.</p><ul><li><p>We will talk more about usenet downloads in the service section.</p></li><li><p>This button, although visible, will not be usable to non-Pro members. It will instead ask you to upgrade to Pro if you hover over it.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Adds an Add Web Link to the dashboard. This allows you to add any link and it will be downloaded to your account. <em>This is commonly used as a debrid for things such as 1Fichier, RapidGator, YouTube, Google Drive and more</em>. The file will transfer to your account and will be available to download, just like a torrent.</p><ul><li><p>We will talk more about web downloads in the service section.</p></li><li><p>This button, although visible will not be usable to free users. It will instead ask you to upgrade to a paid plan if you hover over it.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Web Downloads are shown on the dashboard.</p><ul><li><p>They are shown below the torrents for now. We need to combine them all into the same list, it is some internal frontend issue, we will add sorting and filtering as well soon.</p></li><li><p>You are not able to pause web downloads from the dashboard. Once a download has been started, there is no stopping it, unless you delete it.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Usenet downloads are shown on the dashboard.</p><ul><li><p>Just like web downloads, they are shown below torrents due to internal layouts of the dashboard. This will be addressed soon.</p></li><li><p>You are able to pause and resume usenet downloads, although why would you want to?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Usenet and Web Downloads have the same look and feel as the torrents. They also are just as reactive. Download speeds will count towards the graph on the dashboard as well.</p></li><li><p>Everything basically works the exact same as the torrents. Just click on the download button and you will be brought to the familiar download page to choose the files, and how you want to download the files.</p></li><li><p>Fixed Dial on the left side, which shows the quota free users have left. This has been redone to show fancy colors depending on how many you have left.</p></li><li><p>Changed how the avatar/user section is laid out.</p><ul><li><p>There is no longer a server name, or server IP as internally, users aren't assigned to a server anymore. We will talk about that more in the service section.</p></li><li><p>The space has no been replaced with some cool stats.</p><ul><li><p>You can now see how much data you have downloaded (in torrents, usenet downloads and web downloads, not from TorBox itself).</p></li><li><p>You can now see how much data you have uploaded (data your torrents have seeded).</p></li><li><p>The above data is now used to calculate an overall ratio. There is no risk for having a low ratio or anything, but it is just a cool stat to see. If your ratio is under 1, a sad face will show. If your ratio is over 1, but under 5, a cool face will show. If ratio over 5, there will be a golden crown to show how much of a king (or queen) you are. Basically this is for bragging rights.</p></li><li><p>We will eventually show more dialed in data, such as data for today, data for the week, or data for the month.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong><em> this data started with the update. If you were or are a previous TorBox user, you are still starting fresh, we just don't have data from previous to this update.</em></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Updated Pricing page to reflect changes in free plan and changes to the upper plans.</p></li><li><p>On smaller screens, to avoid overflows, \\\"Add Torrent\\\" is simply \\\"Torrent\\\". We might change how this looks on smaller screens in the future, as we aren't exactly happy with this change.</p></li></ul><h3><strong><em>Service</em></strong></h3><ul><li><p>Added the new Usenet feature. This allows you to access the Usenet without paying for any extra subscritpions. We handle everything from searching (soon), providers, storage and integration into Stremio and the rest of TorBox.</p><ul><li><p>Files are cached just like torrents, so if it is a popular usenet download, it will likely be cached. If it isn't it will download just like normal.</p></li><li><p>Currently we use <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.eweka.nl/en\\\">Eweka</a> and <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://www.newsdemon.com/\\\">Newsdemon</a> as providers. We are going to add blocks soon, and if needed, more providers if users run into issues.</p></li><li><p>We use special <em>20gbit servers</em> to download these usenet files. They are downloaded to enterprise NVME drives and then extracted like normal to the drives. They are then cached to our mass storage servers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Usenet is only available to Pro users.</strong> If you want to use Usenet, make sure to upgrade to our Pro plan for only $10/mo! We don't offer this to free or paid plans as it costs quite a bit for us to offer Usenet.</p></li><li><p>Searching is coming soon. We already search for the Stremio addon, we just need to make it available on the website.</p><ul><li><p>We use multiple indexers, and have been collecting some for awhile. This will allow you to use the best quality, and least likely to fail files. We won't say which ones specifically we use, but just know they are elite and the best indexers you can get access to.</p></li><li><p><em>To address indexer bans: we don't have to worry about getting banned. Files are locked down, and inaccessible to the public (meaning you have to add the files through the site or Stremio to use them). We cache results, so the API's aren't being hit over and over again. Only Pro users are able to use this feature, even using our API, and since it is only a smaller subset of our users, the usage won't be as high as if we offered it to all paid users.</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p>We use a custom self-hosted instance of SABNzbd and we actively sponsor them as well through their PayPal. Thanks to the team for such an awesome and extendable usenet downloader.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Added the new Web Download (debrid) feature.</strong> This allows you to download pretty much any file on the internet without the extra subscription. Just like with Usenet, we handle everything, giving you the most seamless experience possible.</p><ul><li><p>Just like Usenet and Torrents, web downloads (debrid downloads, we refer to them as web downloads) are cached and are instantly available for anyone who downloads them afterwards.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong><em> we don't have a hoster list or a site list yet, that will come soon.</em></p></li><li><p>Usage is pretty much <em>unlimited</em>, but of course, there it all falls under fair use, and will count as an active download until complete, so depending on your plan, you can only download so many at a time. This is the same for all types of downloads. We are adding addons soon that will improve these limits for a small price.</p></li><li><p>We use the same <em>20gbit servers</em> to download the web downloads, so you can be sure that speeds will be quick to download.</p></li><li><p><strong>Web Downloads are only available to paid plans.</strong> Any paid plan has access to web downloads. We don't offer this to free users due to abuse.</p></li><li><p>We use a custom/modified self-hosted <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://pyload.net/\\\">Pyload</a> instance and its API to download your web downloads. Thanks to the team for an awesome service. We have donated to the team through their PayPal as thanks for an awesome service.</p></li><li><p>All web downloads are downloaded through a residential proxy meaning that any file is downloadable, and the server won't get banned from websites or file hosters.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><em>Free user's limitations have been increased</em>. This was done to increase conversion, as the free plan was not meant to be a real plan, rather a trial. We understand that this might be upsetting. In the future, when TorBox becomes financially stable, we can think about bringing these limits back up.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Max size per torrent has been reduced to 50gb</strong>, down from 100gb per torrent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Torrent transfer speed has been reduced to 250mbps</strong> (31.25MB/s on the dashboard), down from 1gbps (125MB/s on the dashboard).</p></li><li><p><strong>6 hour seeding has been reduced to 6 hours</strong>, down from 24 hours.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>In return, all paid plans have been boosted.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Essential and Standard now gets</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited web downloads</strong> (access to web downloads).</p></li><li><p>I<strong>ncrease to 200gb max torrent size per torrent</strong>, from 100gb max torrent size. Many users were complaining it was too small, so we have listened and increased the max size.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Pro gets</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unlimited web downloads</strong> (access to debrid).</p></li><li><p><strong>Unlimited usenet downloads</strong> (access to usenet).</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>We now have switched from our previous server provider, which was Leaseweb. They were mostly good to work with, but the amount we were spending on bandwidth was just way too much, so we have switched. We are very happy with our new providers and are very happy with their services. You can view more about our infrastructure at <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://hetrix.torbox.app\\\">https://hetrix.torbox.app</a>.</p></li></ul><h3><strong><em>Storage</em></strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>The storage API has been rewritten in Rust!</strong> Previously it had been written in Python, but this was not fast enough and we noticed a difference of over 50% speed difference with Python (afterwards) in a production highly concurrent environment. Obviously this is not good, so we went ahead and rewrote the entire thing in Rust. In a server to server environment (different data centers, both 10gbit), we noticed speeds hitting over <strong>3gbps</strong> over Rust (<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://actix.rs/\\\">Actix</a>), whereas using Python (<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\\\">FastAPI</a>), we were maxing out around 1gbps. Of course this is in a perfect environment. Even so, in real-world tests we regularly hit 1.5gbps or higher (concurrently, other users were downloading at the same time).</p><ul><li><p>Apart from the transfer speeds, this also increased zipped download speeds, which is intensely I/O heavy, we have noticed an increase in over 35% speeds, thanks to Rust being highly focused on concurrent threads.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong><em> while downloads are fast, that's only if you can access them. In a few cases, so far around 20% of downloads fail due to the file not existing. This is due to file information not being propagated to all servers in fast enough time, meaning you might access the file over a server that doesn't know the file exists yet. This usually only happens to brand new transfers that just got marked as \\\"Download Ready\\\" or \\\"Cached\\\".

There are quite a few bugs for us to fix, so I guess we will get started on that! Enjoy the new update and let us know if you have any issues! Thank you all for sticking with us through the low points, because it's now only up from here on out!</p>\",\n            \"markdown\": \"This is TorBox's largest update to date. Introducing v4.0, where the major features include, Usenet, Web Downloads (Debrid), a rewritten storage API, and a more stable and reliable service. Along with major features, our infrastructure has changed significantly, and we are pretty much at endgame setup, so things are just scaling up from here.\\n### ***Website***\\n- Adds a Add NZB button to the dashboard. This allows you to add an NZB link or file that will then download the files from the Usenet. The files received from usenet will then be available to download.\\n    - We will talk more about usenet downloads in the service section.\\n    - This button, although visible, will not be usable to non-Pro members. It will instead ask you to upgrade to Pro if you hover over it.\\n    \\n- Adds an Add Web Link to the dashboard. This allows you to add any link and it will be downloaded to your account. *This is commonly used as a debrid for things such as 1Fichier, RapidGator, YouTube, Google Drive and more*. The file will transfer to your account and will be available to download, just like a torrent.\\n    - We will talk more about web downloads in the service section.\\n    - This button, although visible will not be usable to free users. It will instead ask you to upgrade to a paid plan if you hover over it.\\n    \\n- Web Downloads are shown on the dashboard.\\n    - They are shown below the torrents for now. We need to combine them all into the same list, it is some internal frontend issue, we will add sorting and filtering as well soon.\\n    - You are not able to pause web downloads from the dashboard. Once a download has been started, there is no stopping it, unless you delete it.\\n    \\n- Usenet downloads are shown on the dashboard.\\n    - Just like web downloads, they are shown below torrents due to internal layouts of the dashboard. This will be addressed soon.\\n    - You are able to pause and resume usenet downloads, although why would you want to?\\n    \\n- Usenet and Web Downloads have the same look and feel as the torrents. They also are just as reactive. Download speeds will count towards the graph on the dashboard as well.\\n- Everything basically works the exact same as the torrents. Just click on the download button and you will be brought to the familiar download page to choose the files, and how you want to download the files.\\n- Fixed Dial on the left side, which shows the quota free users have left. This has been redone to show fancy colors depending on how many you have left.\\n- Changed how the avatar/user section is laid out.\\n    - There is no longer a server name, or server IP as internally, users aren't assigned to a server anymore. We will talk about that more in the service section.\\n    - The space has no been replaced with some cool stats.\\n        - You can now see how much data you have downloaded (in torrents, usenet downloads and web downloads, not from TorBox itself).\\n        - You can now see how much data you have uploaded (data your torrents have seeded).\\n        - The above data is now used to calculate an overall ratio. There is no risk for having a low ratio or anything, but it is just a cool stat to see. If your ratio is under 1, a sad face will show. If your ratio is over 1, but under 5, a cool face will show. If ratio over 5, there will be a golden crown to show how much of a king (or queen) you are. Basically this is for bragging rights.\\n        - We will eventually show more dialed in data, such as data for today, data for the week, or data for the month.\\n        - ***Please note:**** this data started with the update. If you were or are a previous TorBox user, you are still starting fresh, we just don't have data from previous to this update.*\\n        \\n    \\n- Updated Pricing page to reflect changes in free plan and changes to the upper plans.\\n- On smaller screens, to avoid overflows, \\\"Add Torrent\\\" is simply \\\"Torrent\\\". We might change how this looks on smaller screens in the future, as we aren't exactly happy with this change.\\n\\n### ***Service***\\n- Added the new Usenet feature. This allows you to access the Usenet without paying for any extra subscritpions. We handle everything from searching (soon), providers, storage and integration into Stremio and the rest of TorBox.\\n    - Files are cached just like torrents, so if it is a popular usenet download, it will likely be cached. If it isn't it will download just like normal.\\n    - Currently we use [Eweka](https://www.eweka.nl/en) and [Newsdemon](https://www.newsdemon.com/) as providers. We are going to add blocks soon, and if needed, more providers if users run into issues.\\n    - We use special *20gbit servers* to download these usenet files. They are downloaded to enterprise NVME drives and then extracted like normal to the drives. They are then cached to our mass storage servers.\\n    - **Usenet is only available to Pro users.** If you want to use Usenet, make sure to upgrade to our Pro plan for only $10/mo! We don't offer this to free or paid plans as it costs quite a bit for us to offer Usenet.\\n    - Searching is coming soon. We already search for the Stremio addon, we just need to make it available on the website.\\n        - We use multiple indexers, and have been collecting some for awhile. This will allow you to use the best quality, and least likely to fail files. We won't say which ones specifically we use, but just know they are elite and the best indexers you can get access to.\\n        - *To address indexer bans: we don't have to worry about getting banned. Files are locked down, and inaccessible to the public (meaning you have to add the files through the site or Stremio to use them). We cache results, so the API's aren't being hit over and over again. Only Pro users are able to use this feature, even using our API, and since it is only a smaller subset of our users, the usage won't be as high as if we offered it to all paid users.*\\n        \\n    - We use a custom self-hosted instance of SABNzbd and we actively sponsor them as well through their PayPal. Thanks to the team for such an awesome and extendable usenet downloader.\\n    \\n- **Added the new Web Download (debrid) feature.** This allows you to download pretty much any file on the internet without the extra subscription. Just like with Usenet, we handle everything, giving you the most seamless experience possible.\\n    - Just like Usenet and Torrents, web downloads (debrid downloads, we refer to them as web downloads) are cached and are instantly available for anyone who downloads them afterwards.\\n    - ***Please note:**** we don't have a hoster list or a site list yet, that will come soon.*\\n    - Usage is pretty much *unlimited*, but of course, there it all falls under fair use, and will count as an active download until complete, so depending on your plan, you can only download so many at a time. This is the same for all types of downloads. We are adding addons soon that will improve these limits for a small price.\\n    - We use the same *20gbit servers* to download the web downloads, so you can be sure that speeds will be quick to download.\\n    - **Web Downloads are only available to paid plans.** Any paid plan has access to web downloads. We don't offer this to free users due to abuse.\\n    - We use a custom/modified self-hosted [Pyload](https://pyload.net/) instance and its API to download your web downloads. Thanks to the team for an awesome service. We have donated to the team through their PayPal as thanks for an awesome service.\\n    - All web downloads are downloaded through a residential proxy meaning that any file is downloadable, and the server won't get banned from websites or file hosters.\\n    \\n- *Free user's limitations have been increased*. This was done to increase conversion, as the free plan was not meant to be a real plan, rather a trial. We understand that this might be upsetting. In the future, when TorBox becomes financially stable, we can think about bringing these limits back up.\\n    - **Max size per torrent has been reduced to 50gb**, down from 100gb per torrent.\\n    - **Torrent transfer speed has been reduced to 250mbps** (31.25MB/s on the dashboard), down from 1gbps (125MB/s on the dashboard).\\n    - **6 hour seeding has been reduced to 6 hours**, down from 24 hours.\\n    \\n- **In return, all paid plans have been boosted.**\\n    - Essential and Standard now gets\\n        - **Unlimited web downloads** (access to web downloads).\\n        - I**ncrease to 200gb max torrent size per torrent**, from 100gb max torrent size. Many users were complaining it was too small, so we have listened and increased the max size.\\n        \\n    - Pro gets\\n        - **Unlimited web downloads** (access to debrid).\\n        - **Unlimited usenet downloads** (access to usenet).\\n        \\n    \\n- We now have switched from our previous server provider, which was Leaseweb. They were mostly good to work with, but the amount we were spending on bandwidth was just way too much, so we have switched. We are very happy with our new providers and are very happy with their services. You can view more about our infrastructure at [https://hetrix.torbox.app](https://hetrix.torbox.app).\\n\\n### ***Storage***\\n- **The storage API has been rewritten in Rust!** Previously it had been written in Python, but this was not fast enough and we noticed a difference of over 50% speed difference with Python (afterwards) in a production highly concurrent environment. Obviously this is not good, so we went ahead and rewrote the entire thing in Rust. In a server to server environment (different data centers, both 10gbit), we noticed speeds hitting over **3gbps** over Rust ([Actix](https://actix.rs/)), whereas using Python ([FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)), we were maxing out around 1gbps. Of course this is in a perfect environment. Even so, in real-world tests we regularly hit 1.5gbps or higher (concurrently, other users were downloading at the same time).\\n    - Apart from the transfer speeds, this also increased zipped download speeds, which is intensely I/O heavy, we have noticed an increase in over 35% speeds, thanks to Rust being highly focused on concurrent threads.\\n    \\n- ***Please note:**** while downloads are fast, that's only if you can access them. In a few cases, so far around 20% of downloads fail due to the file not existing. This is due to file information not being propagated to all servers in fast enough time, meaning you might access the file over a server that doesn't know the file exists yet. This usually only happens to brand new transfers that just got marked as \\\"Download Ready\\\" or \\\"Cached\\\". We are working on a solution to this complex issue.*\\n\\n### ***Stremio Addon***\\n- The Stremio addon now has the ability to watch Usenet content if you are on the Pro plan. These will show up as streams, labeled with the type \\\"Usenet\\\".\\n- Torrents now show a type of \\\"Torrents. Usenet downloads now show a type of \\\"Usenet\\\" so you can distinguish them.\\n- If you are a free user using the addon. There will be a small advertisement at the top of the streams asking you to subscribe. It's small and sort of out of the way, and even offers a discount!\\n- Usenet media files are shown in the \\\"Your Media\\\" section in the Discover tab.\\n- ***Please note:**** while movies and short seasons, and popular content has many different options for streams, some edge cases or very large series will not have many streams. We are working on a solution for that. It will be fixed soon.*\\n\\n### ***WebDAV***\\n- Fixes minor bugs with WebDAV not being able to show all of your files.\\n- Shows web downloads and Usenet downloads in WebDAV allowing you to access them just like torrents.\\n\\n### ***Search API***\\n- The search API now has the** **(`/usenet`) endpoint which allows you to search for NZB's on the usenet using our indexers. You can read more about that here [https://search-api.torbox.app/usenet](https://search-api.torbox.app/usenet). [API DOCS.](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/workspace/torbox/collection/29572726-6fbbb607-40cc-440e-b18f-325c563efff4)\\n    - Like written before. No NZB files are accessible. You can see the link, but they are null-routed outside of our network, thanks to Tailscale. For example, here is a link to an NZB: [http://100.126.180.44:4010/getnzb/user/4443484788790234930](http://100.126.180.44:4010/getnzb/user/4443484788790234930). Good luck accessing that.

This also introduces a lot of cool UI changes and features, so read more below!\\n### **Website**\\n- [Adds new pricing page!](https://torbox.app/pricing) This allows you to fully view the pricing and makes for easier comparison between plans.\\n- Changed wording in footer.\\n- Changed wording of some CTA.\\n- Changes color of Manage Subscription button on Dashboard to have more contrast.\\n- Changes MFA code entry form to look a lot nicer and more familiar.\\n- [Changes about page graphic to be a little more fancy.](https://torbox.app/about)\\n- New setting for changing caching settings for torrents added. This allows you to choose 1 of 3 new seeding presets.\\n    - **Auto.** This is the default. Keeping on auto, means that TorBox will decide what torrents will be seeded. TorBox will take into consideration factors such as if the torrent is private, torrent health, seeders, peers and more to make an informed decision whether to seed the torrent or not.\\n        - **NOTE: TorBox will seed more often than not in auto mode.**\\n        \\n    - **Always.** This is the option you choose if you want all of your torrents to seed.\\n    - **Never.** This is the option you choose if you want all of your torrents to not seed.\\n    \\n- New setting for changing caching settings for torrents added through the Stremio addon. This is exactly like the above setting, except that it is specifically for Stremio torrents. This allows you to have even more flexibility when adding torrents.\\n- New Advanced section in the New Torrent popup/dialog that will have additional settings when adding torrents.\\n    - New drop down in this section that is exactly like the above settings, except for overriding your settings for specifically this torrent. If for example, you usually add private torrents, and this is a public torrent, you can make this specific torrent to not seed, but keep your default setting at always seed.\\n    \\n- Removed button asking you to enable notifications on mobile. Most mobile devices don't support push notifications from the browser anyways, so the button was simply removed. If you want notifications on your device, download the mobile app!\\n\\n### **Service**\\n- Now sends a notification on sign in. It tells you the IP and device that was signed into. This way you can keep your account secure if you notice that this wasn't you signing in.\\n- Allowing users to not seed instantly opens up a active torrent slot, and makes the torrent cached rather than seeding and taking up an active slot.\\n\\n### **API**\\n- Adds ability to specify an option on the */createtorrent* path for seeding.\\n    - When sending a multipart form, if you want to specify a seeding setting, send use the key name, *seed*. Accepted values are numbers from 1-3. *1 meaning auto, 2 meaning seed, 3 meaning don't seed.*\\n    \\n\\n### **Search API**\\n- Adds */search/<<query>>* route which allows you to search by any type of query and return metadata for the results.\\n    - Uses Meilisearch in the background so it is super fast, accurate, and you are able to search for literally anything, titles, aliases in other languages, actors, characters, and more.\\n    \\n- Adds tutorial endpoints such as for */meta*, */torrents* and */search*, which tells you all about the endpoints.\\n\\n*Usenet coming next!*\\n\",\n            \"link\": \"https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v37\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2024-03-16T20:29:17Z\",\n            \"id\": \"65f6011ed354ec54c4b65e6a\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"v3.6.4\",\n            \"html\": \"<h3><strong>Website</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Adds a context menu for torrents.

Show off that ratio baby!\\n    - Use the /list command for this.\\n    - If the torrent is ready to download, you can also download the torrent, simply by clicking on the name of the torrent.\\n    \\n- You can also add new torrents! I am not sure if this has ever been done before, but you can upload files and magnet links (even torrent file links) to the bot, and it will add it to your account!\\n    - Use the /add command for this.\\n    - Accepts either a magnet link, or torrent file. You cannot do both at the same time.\\n    - Works as intended!\\n    \\n\\n### **Stremio Addon**\\n- Fixes streams not showing up. I know right? How could I let that happen. IDK!\\n- Speeds up scraper capabilities.\\n- Loosened restrictions on matching media names, meaning that more torrents will show up. The value is still matched at 85% so if a name 85% matches the torrent name then it will pass. Before, it was at 95%.\\n\\n\",\n            \"link\": \"https://feedback.torbox.app/changelog/v361\",\n            \"created_at\": \"2024-03-06T04:51:58Z\",\n            \"id\": \"65e7f1ba61760fa73ad6c73b\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"v3.6\",\n            \"html\": \"<p>The long awaited Stremio addon is available!

Oh boy, this one is a doozy, and really should never really should have happened, but in short, we ended up moving to our own infrastructure on our own servers, with our own API's and all new methods for downloads. There were a lot of reasons why we did this, lets start with those first:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pricing.</strong> To keep TorBox affordable and low price as it is, we have to make sure that we are not spending over our margins, and with our previous solution, <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"http://GoFile.io\\\">GoFile.io</a>, that was not possible. Don't get me wrong, GoFile is extremely cheap at $3/tb, and $2/tb in egress, but unfortunately, not cheap enough for TorBox to be able to sustain itself. With the new infrastructure, we can get infinite egress at no charge, and less than $3/tb, which is already a big deal. TorBox users download over 8tb+ a day from our servers, so we have to make sure that we can handle all of that moving data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Control.</strong> Control over your own storage and the flexibility it gives you is very powerful. We decided to move away because we were tied down to their limited API, as well as no control over how files are served in the slightest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Processing times, and unreliability.</strong> To be able to get the files available for download, they had to be transferred to GoFile's servers. This at times could take quite a long time or even straight up fail. This was completely unacceptable, and we dealt with it for awhile, but GoFile never really completely fixed the issue. They did help us out and made some crucial fixes that made it more manageable, but still never got completely fixed. This was one of our user's largest gripes while using GoFile.</p></li><li><p><strong>Zipped downloads.</strong> GoFile promised us a zipped downloads feature, but never actually delivered on that promise. They had it available, in beta, and to only premium users on their site. As zipped downloads are extremely important on the TorBox platform, this left many users and large torrents practically inaccessible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrations.</strong> With the GoFile downloads, we could never be able to create the integrations we wanted, such as WebDAV, as it would make it nearly impossible due to their lackluster API.</p></li></ol><p>When GoFile was determined to not be usable anymore, we decided to prop up our own infrastructure and start from scratch. This was not an easy or simple journey, and took all the way up to today, this post to get right. Let me take you through what we tried, and the solution we eventually landed on.</p><ol><li><p>We started by trying out <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs\\\">SeaweedFS</a>. This was what we were looking for. A distributed file system, accessible over any machine in the cluster, and had an S3 gateway that allowed us to easily integrate with little effort. This started out great, we got our servers all set up, and got everything going, and at the beginning, things were okay, but didn't really solve all of our problems, and also introduced more. It was definitely cheaper, we had more control, and allowed us to do zipped downloads and integrations, but processing times still were atrocious and unreliable. It also introduced a speed bottleneck. Each server can only handle 1gbit, but the way SeaweedFS is set up, you can't decide where downloads are routed through, so all downloads actually got sent through one heavily speed limited server which was a huge issue and lead to downloads being slow, like 200kbps slow. You can view the issue we made <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/issues/5266\\\">here</a> about our issue.</p></li><li><p>Then we tried out Ceph. Everyone who has dealt with distributed storage knows Ceph. It is a pain to setup and was the main reason we didn't use it. At this point we knew exactly what we wanted. We wanted Hot+Cold storage, instant transfer from torrents stored on the local system to the storage system, and an easy setup. Ceph only solved one of those issues. So we moved on.</p></li><li><p>Then we tried out GarageFS. Again, didn't solve our issues. There was no way to transfer data from the local system to the storage system, without going through the network. They also have no way to do Hot+Cold storage.</p></li><li><p>Then we tried out Minio. Again, didn't solve the local storage issue.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we tried out Rclone. This solved the issue of local storage issue, as we could use raw files as the storage system thanks to Alias. We were able to make a unified filesystem using all the servers using Union, and serving that over S3, we could route downloads properly. We were also able to implement hot and cold servers based off of remotes and only transferring new torrents to hot servers, all in the background, which also eliminated processing times, and made things really easy to setup over the command line, using a <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://gist.github.com/Wamy-Dev/4f10e107d812f13813a20fc7de2ce24a\\\">single bash script</a>. We ran into a few issues though:</p><ol><li><p>The S3 gateway was impossible to secure down, meaning that for a period of time you could clone the entire TorBox cache and it was publicly available. This was a huge problem. You can read more about <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7616\\\">the issue here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Given the issues we had with hosting S3 over Rclone, we decided to try out something called S3Proxy. The problem here was that presigned requests simply didn't work which is how we gave out download links. There were also issues with authorization not working either, exposing the entire TorBox Cache. You can read more about <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy/issues/581\\\">that issue here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Downloads were unstable. They would crash half way through, couldn't be resumed, and you could not use Multi-connection downloads like you could before.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>So we ended up writing another API specifically for the storage, which basically allows us to solve all of the issues we were facing. The TorBox cache is now completely private, download links are clean and simple to use. Errors are intuitive and have a nice page for users to look at. Downloads can be resumed, you can use up to 16 connections, zips are very easy to use, and no buffering slowdowns either. We did deal with some issues regarding speeds, but for now, they are adequate. We have been making optimizations (thanks to our control over the entire system) and speeds have been climbing. Right now you can expect to hit around 60-70MB/s, but we are trying to get closer to the theoretical maximum which is about 110MB/s. There are so many optimizations we are trying and testing, so I am confident we can get there. Anyways, that is the story of why there have been no updates in forever. We have been dealing with storage, to give our users the best experience possible.</p><p><em>Now onto the actual change log:</em></p><h3><strong>Website:</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Updated main page speedtest to download the test files.</p><ul><li><p>Available is a 100MB file, 1GB file, and 10GB file.

This will come back in a future update. There were too many problems with it, and I decided to skip migrating web downloads to v3 as well.</p></li></ul><h3><em>Downloads (Download Page)</em></h3><ul><li><p>Improved the Google Drive integration.

Simply click the button, log in, and it will begin working.</p></li><li><p>This is the fastest way to add your files to the cloud out of any of the integrations thanks to being able to upload 60MB at a time to the cloud rather than only 256KB in the case of Google Drive.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Added the ability to use the all integrations with folders (zip files). This way, for torrents with a lot of files, you can just click one button rather than many. All integrations work with the zip files (Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive).</p></li><li><p>Zip files are now support multi-connection downloads thanks to GoFile supporting it.</p></li><li><p>You can no longer view files on TorBox, you must go to <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" class=\\\"text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-300 cursor-pointer\\\" href=\\\"http://GoFile.io\\\">GoFile.io</a>.

With essentially no load on the hard drives (other than uploading to GoFile once), this frees up precious IOPS needed to hit high transfer speeds. Before, downloads were made from the same file that the server was seeding from meaning that the load on the drives were so much that sometimes downloads would crawl to a stop. This is no longer the case thanks to GoFile's excellent CDN and reliability, you will be able to download at or near your bandwidth speed.</p></li><li><p>The second is that it gives TorBox more room to grow, thanks to a lower budget needed for servers, we can put more money into features, integrations, marketing and more for the best experience.</p></li><li><p>The final reason is scaling and the future of TorBox.

Here are some interesting stats:\\n**Frontend**\\n37 hours, 2 minutes spent coding\\n169 commits\\n**Backend**\\n63 hours, 7 minutes spent coding\\n194 commits\\nThat's a lot of time to get to this point. Its something to be proud of though. So far the service is the best looking UI I have ever built, thanks to Fero. Not just the design, but other than a few other projects, (and after the rewrite) this is my most bullet proof API as well. It was a lot to get to this point, but I want to thank everyone in my Discord as well as other service who gave me very constructive advice and bugs to fix. All that time together, we have created something awesome and something that I believe will last for a long time. Enough with the gushy stuff, here is what has changed.\\n- The IDM and Jdownloader buttons have been combined into one \\\"Add to Download Manager\\\" button. This also \\\"allows\\\" user for users who like pyload or downthemall without making things confusing.\\n- Downloading folders is a little bit more intuitive and user friendly thanks to the popup. You can now see exactly what buttons do.\\n- The \\\"Currently \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\" text on the torrents has been made a little bit more intuitive and user friendly as some of the previous statuses were a little difficult to understand.\\n- Torrents are now triple checked before being marked as \\\"Inactive\\\" and not being allowed to download anymore.\\n- Torrents on the dashboard actually update now. IDK what I did to break it, but it's fixed now.\\n- Rewrote the satellite network to be more like a cluster rather than forcing a torrent to only go to one satellite. Instead its now distributed based off of load, storage space, and other factors.\\n- You now get web notifications when the torrent has gone inactive.\\n- Added bot detection using Cloudflare's turnstile for logging in.\\n- When adding torrrents, only free user's have to wait for the captcha to complete. If you are on a paid plan, you get to skip the captcha process (takes less than 5 seconds).\\n- The satellite relays can now handle *infinite* users rather than crashing on high load.\\n\\nI am excited to continue working on this project, and hopefully the launch on Reddit in a few days goes well.

			"description": "### Overview\n\nThis is the way to identify TorBox user's as well as get information about the user you are working with. This data contains important endpoints that allow you to control and view data on the account.\n\n### Authorization\n\nFor all requests, you will need your API token which can be found on your [TorBox settings page ](https://torbox.app/settings) under the API key section. Simply copy or refresh the API token and use it in the API. Some requests may require a `session_token` which you can find in the local storage of your browser on any TorBox.app page.\n\n### Device Code Flow\n\nThe device code flow is used for obtaining a user's API token in an easy and simple fashion without requiring a user to type in the long API tokens into TV or other similar devices. This can make authorization into your app much simpler and user-friendly.\n\n1. First start the flow by sending a `GET` request to `/auth/device/start`, with your app in the `app` parameter.\n    \n    1. This will return all the necessary information.\n        \n        1. `device_code`, which your app will use for consecutive requests later in the process.\n            \n        2. `code` which you will show to the user to be entered at the verification_url.\n            \n        3. `verification_url`, which you will show as a QR code or direct link for them to go to.\n            \n    2. Make sure to include your app name in the `app` parameter of the request so the user clearly understands what they are linking to.\n        \n        1. This app name only allows alpha-numeric characters for user-safety.\n            \n    3. These requests are only valid for _10 minutes_, make sure the user is aware of this time limit.\n        \n2. Once you have started the process, the user will be asked to go to the `verification_url` to login and enter the code.\n    \n    1. It is expected that you show the `verification_url` as a QR code or the `friendly_verification_url` as a direct URL for the user to enter.\n        \n        1. The `friendly_verification_url` does not include your app name, as it is expected to be short and easy to type in. It will simply say \"Third Party App\".\n            \n    2. Do not redirect to this `verification_url`, ie: put your own domain in front of it.\n        \n        1. If you need a short URL, use the `friendly_verification_url`.\n            \n    3. The code must be visible to the user and large enough to see from a distance.\n        \n        1. Here are some reference screens that other similar apps have implemented:\n            \n        2. [Plex](https://kagi.com/proxy/Plex_HTPC-3.png?c=-XuxjXfVBkjmWh0e6M3mu0Ja_qFalBU0EEtBzDSjCQnWWM0bVJqP3SaImMhGp7Ze1b95V_inIj8XPw1hRCXIBIV8CFUsgIn9iwV7js-C6YOCUnc5qarCDsNtHpIzt71_)\n            \n        3. [Disney+](https://kagi.com/proxy/disney-login-and-streaming-support-now-available-at-select-walt-disney-world-hotels-3.jpeg?c=H4fwbi1ywNt-hN8_-XoZobzEAioesspw-Cezkik4otwtH4-Sl542JrovwqGg5YgrkoztHQ5XZCb2v92aOfS29vk8yuzVlt2EZ5yvdmK2Du8QWn6HYJ3CoQSsUNv2F5gYBruzZvGx-RSAsxmQ9sBaBzZrQqypkL6doTQDYYrh_nQI-Jgm85VBI_lmgP62k80XA5qOY2-Ml1pWLuqoiKmYuA%3D%3D)\n            \n        4. [YouTube](https://kagi.com/proxy/servlet.FileDownload?c=mphvmZAxU_feDw_DE8MblueiK55hLm8EV1q1FXYaU4fMhr6hxGoqL8wlcTanqqqfFSeVsYiKLl-yu3sLHx1D96P36s3B97mh-430a0yop09_hMNtdUVoLqw0Aipy82Rj2C4C9cHChCbkCstl0DSeWw%3D%3D)\n            \n    4. All codes are 6 digit integers for simplicity.\n        \n    5. Free users are not able to use this endpoint. They will be shown an error when attempting to verify this code.\n        \n    6. Instructions should be simple and easy to follow.\n        \n3. Use the `interval` in the `/auth/device/start` response to check if the user has authenticated the code by sending `POST` requests to `/auth/device/token` with the `device_code` in the json body. This will return a `400` error (or use the `success` key) until the user has validated the code. Continuously poll this endpoint until it returns a success response.\n    \n4. Once the `/auth/device/token` request returns a successful response, the user's API token will be included in the response json. This concludes the device code authorization flow.\n    \n\n### Endpoints `/api/user`\n\n- `POST` Refresh API Token `/refreshtoken`\n    \n- `GET` Get User Data `/me`\n    \n- `POST` Add Referral To Account `/addreferral`\n    \n- `GET` Get Confirmation Code `/getconfirmation`\n    \n- `GET` Start Device Code Authorization Process `/auth/device/start`\n    \n- `POST` Get Token From Device Code Process `/auth/device/token`"

This affects how the item is downloaded, as well as what is scraped, so make sure it is correct. When the parent RSS feed's type is changed, it changes all of the items types as well.\n\n- **\"**torrent**\"** `uses .torrent files and magnet links and adds as torrent when downloaded.`\n- \"usenet\" `uses .nzb files and nzb links and adds as a usenet download when downloaded.`\n- \"webdl\" `uses generic links and adds as a web download when downloaded.`\n    \n\n##### Status Key\n\nThe \"status\" key tells the status of the RSS feed item. This is useful for seeing what the item is doing, and what it will do next. Each item also includes a \"status_message\" key which gives a user friendly message about anything about the RSS feed item, such as errors and explainations.\n\n- \"new\" `the RSS feed item is set to be downloaded.`\n- \"ignored\" `the RSS feed item has been ignored due to the parents RSS feed settings, as it doesn't match the chosen settings. The item will not be downloaded.`\n- \"error\" `the RSS feed item had an error while attempting to download. The item will be retried on the next scrape.`\n- \"downloaded\" `the RSS feed item has already been downloaded to the user's account. It will not be downloaded again.`\n    \n\n### Authorization\n\nRequires an API key using the Authorization Bearer Header."

Instead on the [/creatorrent](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/uf2r2v9/create-torrent?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=29572726&ctx=documentation), [/createusenetdownload](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/zczxfjg/create-usenet-download?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=29572726&ctx=documentation), and [/createwebdownload](https://www.postman.com/wamy-dev/torbox/request/1n4778x/create-web-download?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=29572726&ctx=documentation) routes, you can send the \"as_queued\" form data set to \"true\" and the download will be created as a queued download.

To view all available indexes, you must request this endpoint intially with \"null\" or 0, for the chosen indexes. This will return a metadata dictionary in the response, which will contain the list of audios and subtitles available for this stream. When choosing a subtitle or audio stream, use the **relative index**, starting from 0, rather than the \"index\" value. This is important for selecting the correct index. Once your user gets a selection of audios and subtitles available, you can submit this to the endpoint again to get the chosen stream.\n\n- **null** - Selecting no subtitle. Not available for audio as one must always be selected.\n    \n- **0** - Selecting first subtitle or audio\n    \n\n#### Types\n\nThis endpoint allows you to handle torrents, usenet and web downloads all in one. This is why the \"type\" parameter is available. It defaults to \"torrent\".\n\n- **torrent** - Torrents\n    \n- **usenet** - Usenet downloads\n    \n- **webdownload** - Web Downloads\n    \n\n#### Important Notes\n\n- Only text based subtitles are supported. If a non-text based subtitle is selected, it will be ignored.\n    \n- If a subtitle or audio index does not exist on the stream, it will be ignored.\n    \n- There are a lot of edge-case videos, if something doesn't work, don't hesitate to report the download hash and file_id of the failing video file.\n    \n- This is a **Pro** only feature.\n    \n\n### Authorization\n\nRequires an API key using the Authorization Bearer Header."
