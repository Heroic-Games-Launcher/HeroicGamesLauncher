Heroic is an Open Source Game Launcher for Linux, Windows and macOS.  
Right now it supports launching games from the Epic Games Store using [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary), GOG Games using our custom implementation with [gogdl](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/heroic-gogdl) and Amazon Games using [Nile](https://github.com/imLinguin/nile).

Heroic is built with Web Technologies:

## Installation

### Linux

#### Flatpak

[<img src="https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png" alt="Flathub Badge" width="10%" />](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl)

Heroic is available on Flathub, so you should be able to easily install it on most distros with Software Centers (Pop!\_Shop, Discover, etc.)

#### Distribution-specific instructions

If you're not using the Flatpak version, make sure you have all Wine dependencies installed:
[Wine Dependencies](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md).

#### Debian, Ubuntu and Derivatives

Download the file ending in .deb from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest).  
Double-click it to open it up in your Software Manager, or run `sudo dpkg -i heroic_*_amd64.deb` to install it directly:

#### Arch (AUR)

We currently only support one AUR package: `heroic-games-launcher-bin`. Although you might find other packages there, do not ask support for them on this Github or on our Discord, ask their maintainers directly.

- [![Stable version badge](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/heroic-games-launcher-bin?style=flat&label=heroic-games-launcher-bin)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/heroic-games-launcher-bin)  
  (stable release, recommended)

Please see [the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages) on how to install them

#### Fedora

##### COPR repo

Heroic for Fedora is available on [this COPR repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/heroic-games-launcher/).  
Enable it with `sudo dnf copr enable atim/heroic-games-launcher`, then install Heroic with `sudo dnf install heroic-games-launcher-bin`

##### Binary package from the releases page

You can alternatively download the file ending in .rpm from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest) and install it with `sudo dnf install ./heroic-*.x86_64.rpm`

#### Other Distributions (AppImage and TAR.XZ)

Since these two distribution formats don't have a form of dependency management, make sure the `curl` command is available. You might run into weird issues if it's not.

##### AppImage

- Download the file ending in .AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Make it executable (`chmod +x Heroic*.AppImage`)
- Run it (double-click in most file managers, or run `./Heroic*.AppImage`)

##### .tar.xz

- Download the file ending in .tar.xz from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest)
- Extract it anywhere
- Run the `heroic` file in the folder you extracted it to (double-click in most file managers, or run `./heroic`)

### Windows

#### WinGet

If you use WinGet (installed by default on Windows 11 and modern versions of 10), you can run `winget install Heroic` in a terminal to install Heroic.

#### Manual installl

Download the Heroic Installer (`Heroic-x.x.x-Setup.exe`) or the portable version (`Heroic-x.x.x-Portable.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest). Run the executable you downloaded to install/run Heroic.  
The Setup will create shortcuts to Heroic on your Desktop and in your Start Menu.

### macOS

If you use Homebrew, you can run `brew install --cask --no-quarantine heroic` to install Heroic.  
Otherwise, download the file ending in .dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/latest), double-click it to mount it, and drag the "Heroic" application into the "Applications" folder.

## Development environment

This part will walk you through setting up a development environment so you can build Heroic binaries yourself or make changes to the code.

1. Make sure Git, NodeJS, and pnpm 9 are installed  
   **NOTE**: On Windows, due to an issue with electron-builder, you'll need the standalone version of pnpm (`@pnpm/exe`)
   to build packages
2. Clone the repo and enter the cloned folder, for example with these commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher.git --recurse-submodules
   cd HeroicGamesLauncher
   ```

3. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `pnpm install`

### Building Heroic Binaries

Run the appropriate command for your OS:

- Build for Linux:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:linux # Optionally specify a package to create (eg: deb, pacman, tar.xz, rpm, AppImage); default: AppImage
  ```

- Build for Windows:

  ```bash
  pnpm dist:win
  ```

- Build for Mac:
  ```bash
  pnpm dist:mac
  ```

### Building with VS Code

Instead of using the above commands to build Heroic, you can also use the Tasks in VSCode to build.
To do that, open up the command palette (Ctrl + P), type in "task" and press Space. You will then see 3 build tasks, "Build for Linux", "Build for Windows", and "Build for MacOS". Click the one you want to run.

### Quickly testing/debugging Heroic on your own system

If you want to quickly test a change, or you're implementing features that require a lot of restarts, you can use Vite's development server to speed up the process:  
Go to the "Run and Debug" tab of VSCode and start the "Launch Heroic (HMR & HR)" task (alternatively, if you're not using VSCode or just prefer the terminal, run `pnpm start`). Heroic will start up after a short while, and once you make any change to the code, it'll reload/restart.
